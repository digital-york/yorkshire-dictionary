acorn ,,,,,,,," The demand for charcoal increased from the sixteenth century and that brought pressure to bear on the woods. The situation was made worse by neglect during the Civil War and as a result some landowners had to make strenuous efforts to preserve and increase the spring woods on their estates. Oak was the principal tree in demand, and estate records show that new woods were being created. In 1647-54, for example, Sir Henry Cholmeley ploughed up pasture next to a wood called <i>Starrat Spring</i> and was <i>sowing Ackornes & Sycamore chatts</i> (Mss3/210): in 1741 Mr Beaumont of Whitley Hall paid 10s 6d <i>To Thomas Lodge for plowing two acres of Land in Gregory Spring to sow with Acrons </i>(WBE/1/14) and in 1746 <i>Land </i>[was]<i> taken off the Lodge Farm and laid to Gregory Spring</i> (WBE/1/19). This was arable or meadow set aside for the expansion of the established spring wood. Acorns were also collected for animal fodder but it was a practice controlled by by-laws: 1472 <i>Item we say that thar sall no man geder non akcornes in the comone wod in pane of xvjd</i>, Selby (SS85/26); 1545 ‘enjoined that no one fell <i>le aikcorn with roddes 12d</i>’, Methley (Th35/209); 1552 <i>None shall dinge down ackornes of the trees under penalty of 3s 4d; none shall gather aickhornes in another’s tenement – 12d,</i> Middleton (CHT126). The acorn was a motif much used as decoration in jewellery and household items, especially a type of silver spoon: 1490 <i>vj cocliaria arg. cum lez acornez deaur.,</i> York (SS53/54); 1570 <i>Item sex silver spownes with the acorns heade</i>, South Cave (Kaner68).",chatt,Mss3/210,,1647-54,np,WBE/1/14,,1741,Whitley Hall,WBE/1/19,,1746,np,SS85/26,,1472,Selby,Th35/209,,1545,Methley,CHT126,,1552,Middleton,SS53/54,"Will of Thomas Pereson, Sub-dean of York, 1492, Reg 5 fol. 415v-417v (BIA)",1490,York,Kaner68,"Will of John Johnson, South Cave, 1570, South Cave Peculiar (BIA)",1570,South Cave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

acredike,acregarth,acrewall,,,,,,"It was Angus Winchester who drew attention to the names given to the ‘fence’ which acted as a boundary between cultivated land and the open hillside in upland parishes. He discussed, among others, the terms felldyke, headgarth and acredike (AW53), and the last of these, with local variations, is well documented in Yorkshire. ‘Acre’ is a reference to the cultivated land although the precise meaning of the compound term may have differed from one community to another: <i>c</i>.1200 <i>ad caput ipsius rivuli quod est in Acrewal et sic de Acrewall recte intransversum versus …, </i>Beamsley (EYCh7/130); 1334 <i>et eciam fugare ad vulpes et lepores infra les Acredikes de Alverstan et Farmanby</i> (NRR3/112); 1354 <i>communa pasturæ quæ habeo vel habui … infra Acregarth in villis de Whiteby, Stakeseby, Neuham, Presteby </i>(SS72/429). Among later references quoted by Winchester are <i>akerdykes</i> at Lartington in 1444 and <i>akirgarthez </i>at Sedbergh in 1457 (AW55). It should be noted, though, that identical terms occurred away from the uplands. For example, in undated deeds of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, land in North Cave lay ‘next <i>Ackerdyk</i>’ (YRS83/84) and <i>Akerdic</i> occurred in Bempton, again undated (ERPN107).

That meant, I believe, that it was not possible to value rough, uncultivated land in the way that arable land was valued. The custom was explicit in Farnley Tyas in 1583 when it was said that every person should be <i>rated towards the said laye </i>[tax]<i> according to his oxganges of land</i> (DT/179), taxed therefore in proportion to his holding in the town fields. In 1674 townsmen from different parts of the West Riding made a request at the Quarter Sessions that the church and poor assessments should be <i>either by pound rent or by accar tale</i> (QS1/13/7), and in Cudworth in 1638 an assessment <i>made by acre tale</i> took into account <i>the quantitie and quallitie of the lands</i> (YAJ5/385).

The occupation was established in Scarborough from the fourteenth century at least: 1391 <i>Johannes Eston de Scardeburgh le Ankersmyth</i> (SS4/163): in his will this man left his anvil, great hammers, smaller hammers and pairs of tongs to an apprentice and a near relative (SS4/163). The other early references were also in Scarborough: 1432 <i>John Alissonson, Scardeburgh, ankersmyth</i> (YRS6/3); 1522 <i>Robert Clerke, ankarsmyth</i> (SS79/154); 1588 <i>Thomas Clarke, Skarbroughe, ankker smythe</i> (YRS22/27). Baines’s North Riding directory of 1822 had three entries under ‘Anchor Smiths’, and they included William and Benjamin March of Sand side, Scarborough.

anent,anenst,,,,,,," The etymology of ‘anent’ is interesting, for it is said to derive from the Old English <i>on efen</i>, or <i>on even</i> if we use the modern equivalent (OED): 1420 <i>the post ... anent the lede in the same workhouse</i>, York (SS85/16). It can be compared with ‘again, against’ and meant literally ‘on a level with’ or ‘side by side with’: it progressed to ‘anent’ and ‘anenst’ via Middle English <i>onevent</i> and the former spelling survived in local dialects: 1782 <i>a man pulling a Piece at Lowwestwood Mill anent another man, the hands slipping, fell backwards into the millrace,</i> Golcar (KC242/1). It could denote position, with the meanings ‘against’ or ‘next to’, as in a Wakefield by-law of 1556 which required every tenant <i>to make the pavement anenste his house </i>(YRS74/22). In a South Crosland title deed of 1570, a riverside meadow was said to abut <i>upon the landes of Richard Beaumont, esquire, anenste the weste … and upon the water of Colne anenste the este </i>(YDK82). Similarly, in 1584, the manorial boundary in Almondbury was said to run <i>along the bottom of the Netherwooding, right anenst the north side of … Robert Royd Ing</i> (MS205). </br>In many sixteenth-century examples ‘anenst’ meant ‘against’ in the sense of ‘towards’ or ‘with regard to’, and this occurs in a document of 1443 which referred to riotous behaviour at Fountains Abbey. Those involved, including Sir John Neville, were ordered <i>to kepe the pees anenst th’abbot and convent … and their servantz and welwillers</i> (SS42/222). The word also occurred quite frequently in situations where an individual sought to discharge himself of some liability. Typical expressions in this case are: 1481 <i>theise oure lettres shalbe your sufficiant warant and discharge anempst us, </i>York (YRS103/18); 1552 <i>so that he shall discharge me eneynst the Kynge for my haryotte</i> (SS104/64). The ‘haryotte’; that is heriot, was a feudal payment made by an incoming tenant - often his best beast. Also at Fountains there were penalties in 1520 for <i>trespasses doon … both anenste dere and woddes</i> (YRS140/239). Unusual spellings are commonplace: in a York document of 1590 it was agreed that whoever <i>should laye anye dounge in Hungate enenpste the Frear walles should pay for every burden 12d</i> (YRS138/126).

apparel ,,,,,,,," We have little information about the clothing worn by workmen in the past. The picture of a collier in Walker’s <i>The Costume of Yorkshire</i> (1814) provides us with one image of how a coal-miner might have dressed away from the pit: much earlier, in 1691-2, a Colsterdale banksman was distinguished from other workers by wearing <i>a frock and cap for the purpose </i>(BM82/38). For the men who worked underground there was probably no ‘dress code’ since even ventilated pits were almost certainly oppressively stuffy: indeed we learn from a seventeenth-century deposition that some miners worked naked or semi-naked. There are just a few references to their working attire: in 1692 William Goodall of Farnley received 6d <i>to pay for his clogs </i>and in 1695 Richard Child was allowed<i> 1s 1d  for an Apperon </i>(MS11), probably one made from leather.

arch  ,rough arch,,,,,,"A ‘bowed’ or curved structure, a word recorded frequently in bridge documents."," Such arches can be pleasing to the eye but they were designed to bear loads, and were not just ornamental features: they required firm foundations, strong abutments and skilful siting.

The word was prominent in a Kirkstall agreement of 1616 which opened with the statement that the bridge was <i>intended to be brought over the Ryver with one Arche, </i>and was then followed by items relating to the <i>Settinge of both the Arches</i> which initially seems to contradict the first statement. It is clear though that this included <i>on</i>[e]<i> course Arche</i> a term that I have not otherwise met with. In a memorandum of 1619 there was a distinction in price between <i>the Nether Archstones</i> at 3½d per foot and <i>the over Arch stones</i> at 3d per foot (BAS6/146-7). Perhaps the ‘course [coarse?] arch’ can be compared with <i>the rough Arch</i> of Paythorne Bridge in 1687 (QS1).

The variant spelling 'earls; was in common and widespread use in Yorkshire from the seventeenth century at least. In 1612, for example, Mr Cholmeley gave his employee Davison an earles of 6d, Brandsby (NYRO44/56).  In Durham the expenses of hiring a herdsman in 1652 included 6d ‘in arles’ (OED). In the township records for Honley, in 1763-78, <i>arles</i> were included several times in payments to labourers working on the roads (CP/HO). In the eighteenth century the word is found in accounts of all kinds, and the inference is that arles were increasingly seen as a gratuity, one of several payments in cash, meat or drink that were part of a workman’s normal terms of employment: 1755 the accounts of a colliery in Tong, included the expense of earls of wood, and colliers to drink (Mss4c/1).",earnest; fest; gods-penny; pot,NYRO44/56,,1612,Brandsby,CP/HO,,1763-78,Honley,OED,,1652,Durham,Mss4c/1,,1755,Tong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

arrow-head smith ,,,,,,," A maker of iron arrow-heads, like ‘arrowsmith’. The shaft and the head of an arrow were made by different workmen, and the heads were the responsibility of a specialist smith."," In earlier centuries arrows had an intrinsic value and were sometimes used to settle rents in lieu of cash payments or services. In 1257-8, Elias de Knolle held land in Slaidburn valued at ‘12 barbed arrows’ (YRS12/48) and in an undated thirteenth-century grant  of land in Swinton, the grantee paid ‘one arrow at the nativity of Saint John … for all secular services, suits, taxes, customs and demands’ (TWH16/5). The Sheffield smiths evidently enjoyed a national reputation for they supplied arrow-heads to the constable of Chester Castle in 1401-2 when weapons were needed to counter the threat from Owain Glyn Dwr. One entry was for 2,000 arrowheads from <i>John del Smythy </i>de Sheffeld (SC 6/774/14). The occupational term was later than ‘arrowsmith’: 1500 <i>Richard Bright of the Hurlowe </i>[Whirlow] <i>… arowehedsmyth</i> (TWH14/36); 1556 <i>Thomas Mytchell, Owlerton … arrowhead smythe</i> (YRS14/115); 1558 <i>Robart Bayte, Darnall, Sheffeld, arrowhedsmythe</i> (YRS14/12); 1593 <i>William Carr, Darnell</i> … <i>arrowheadsmith</i> (YRS22/23). An Act was passed in 1541-2 which was designed to prevent the decline of archery by reinforcing earlier statutes which had debarred the playing of ‘unlawful’ games. It was in response to a petition by all the tradesmen involved in making bows and arrows, including the arrow-head makers (YRS3/47). Nevertheless the trade inevitably declined over the next one hundred years and the Twiggs of Attercliffe were apparently the last Sheffield family to make arrow-heads (FBH134): no references to the craft have been found later than 1660.",arrowsmith,YRS12/48,,1257-8,Slaidburn,TSH16/5,,nd[1200-1299],Swinton,SC6/774/14,,1401-2,Chester,TQH14/36,,1500,Hurlowe,YRS14/115,,1556,Owlerton,YRS14/12,,1558,Sheffield,YRS22/23,,1593,Darnell,YRS3/47,,1541-2,np,FBH134,,nd,Attercliffe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ash  ,,,,,,,,"In the historic period the ash has been one of the dominant trees in the Yorkshire landscape, equally as important as the oak. It is an element in major place-names which date from the period of Anglian and Norse settlement, for example, Askern, Askwith, Esholt and Eshton. Numerous minor places are named Ash or Ashes and it is also an occasional generic, as in <i>Longheshe</i> (PNWR7/152). Barkston Ash which served as the wapentake meeting place may preserve the memory of a distinctive tree. Particular ashes were part of the community’s collective memory: a map of Rastrick dated 1625 has a sketch of an ash tree and is accompanied by a note saying<i> that the Ashe tree is felled and was cut downe within the memorye of man</i> (DD/SR/10/218). It was highly valued as a source of timber: 1292-3 <i>De fraxinis venditis ad travours viijli iiijd,</i> Bolton Priory (YRS154/47): a clause in the leases of Settrington tenants obliged them to plant and preserve a number of <i>oke or Ashe Timber trees</i> yearly and these were regularly counted: 1599-1600 <i>Ashe tymber trees super le Northflatt 120</i>, Settrington (YRS126/29,82).

ashburner ,,,,,,," A person who burns ‘ashes’, that is produces potash, principally as a lye for soap-making."," 1462 <i>John Jewell, asshbrynner, </i>York (SS96/182). The by-name ‘askbrenner’ occurred much earlier in several parts of Yorkshire: n.d. <i>Roger Ascbrennar</i>, Scaling (YRS92/144); 1308 <i>William the Askebrenner</i>, Holme (YRS36/160); 1339 <i>Robert Askebrenner</i>, Sowerby (WCR12/65). Wood or bracken were burnt and known as ‘soap ashes’ or ‘wood ashes’: in 1587 Mr Kaye of Woodsome Hall <i>payd for the stubbing</i> of parts of his woodland which produced <i>20 loods of soope ashe </i>(KayeCP) and in Holmfirth an agreement between two tenants in 1586 included <i>boon work in autumn viz one day mawynge and half of all the potash burned </i>(WCR4/62). The inventory of Christopher Sikes of Lepton linked <i>manure and sope ashes</i> in 1644 (HM/C/181) and in 1755 the Mirfield diarist Joseph Ismay listed <i>Soot, Soap Ashes</i> and <i>Rape Dust </i>as items which were in occasional use as ‘manure’ (D/I/192).

ash heap,ash-hole,ash house,ash-pit,,,,These are all places where ashes accumulated or could be placed.," The terms are not well documented. In furnaces and fire-places they were chambers into which ashes might fall but as places outside a dwelling-house they could be where ashes and household refuse was collected, sometimes small buildings. When William Rothenstein the artist wrote about his childhood in Bradford in the 1870s he vividly remembered <i>the backyard, stone-flagged, with a stone ash-pit, a small building for rubbish</i>. The ash-pits had an <i>acrid smell</i> and <i>boys used to set rat-traps in them</i>. Earlier references include: 1603 <i>the messuage, one asse house … the barne</i>, Netherthong (G-A); 1764 <i>coalehole, ashes hole</i>, Crosland (G-A).

It has had a fascinating semantic history in English but was used from an early date primarily of stone, descriptive of hewn blocks which were worked to a fine surface and closely jointed: these gave prestigious buildings an imposing façade: 1412 <i>xx carectas lapidum, exceptis … ascheleres et flagges</i>, York (SS35/200); 1494 <i>Saynt Elyn wharell ... et lapides ibidem inventos vocatos Ashlerstones</i>, Roxby (NRR1/169); 1558 <i>all my tymber redy to build with all my slayt stone and ashler stone</i>, Wakefield (Th27/264).

assart  ,sart,essart,,,,,"A piece of land cleared of trees, intended for cultivation."," The word entered the language from Old French but its etymology ties it to Latin <i>ex sartum</i>, literally the grubbing out of the tree roots. The first OED references are to the verb in 1276 and the noun in 1598 but place-name evidence is much earlier. For instance, the affix of Kirkby Malzeard dates from <i>c</i>.1100 and has spellings such as <i>Malassart</i> that is ‘bad clearing’. References are numerous in charters from that time: <i>c</i>.1148 <i>et duas bovetas in Hilleclaia </i>[Ilkley]<i> cum sartis eidem terre pertinentibus</i>, Sawley (YRS87/3); 1279 <i>quod nulle … ibidem per Fontanienses fiant purpresture vel assarta</i>, Sawley Abbey (YRS90/15); 1313-4 <i>pro assartacione apud Kyldewyk viijs</i>; 1317-8 <i>de increment j assarti quod Paulus tenet</i>, Bolton Priory (YRS154/365,438). Many of the Yorkshire place-names which derive from these assarts had the suffix <i>rydding</i> or, more usually, <i>rod</i>,  e.g. 1360 ‘an assart called <i>Thistelerod</i>’, Fixby (YRS63/33). They survive frequently as ridding and royd. </br> 'Essart', an alternative spelling, was commonly found as a by-name from the twelfth century:  1154 et Hugone de Essartis, York (YRS87/35). Genealogical work can sometimes link such a by-name with the surnames Royds or Rhodes, and the North Bierley mansion Royds Hall may owe its name to the Jordan de Essartis who witnessed an early but undated Hunsworth charter (YRS50/88).

attach (2),attachment (2),,,,,,," For centuries it was water power that drove the mills which ground our corn and fulled the weavers’ cloth, and in order for that power to be used effectively it was necessary to construct dams and weirs on our rivers which would halt or control the flow of water. The dams had to be secured on both banks and that was not a problem when they were in one man’s possession. Often though two parties were involved and only one of those stood to gain financially from the building of the dam, so agreements had to be worked out which would satisfy the prospective mill-owner and his neighbour across the river. The word used for the securing of the dam was ‘attachment’, and the evidence for that dates from the thirteenth century: <i>a</i>.1245 <i>concesserunt dicto Willelmo de Percy … attachiamentum cujusdam stagni</i>, Haggenby (YRS92/69); 1264 <i>pro atachiamento stagni molendini de Kerbi</i> (YRS12/94); 1301-2 <i>de atachiamento stagni de Kildewyk</i> (YRS154/127). </br>Examples in English are found regularly from the fifteenth century: 1473-4 <i>to knytte, attache, festen and make of new another new werre and milnedame</i>, Barnsley (JB123).

More explicitly, in 1539, <i>the attachment of a dame</i> at Fenay Bridge near Huddersfield was said <i>to be jonyd, sett and festenyd in and upon … Briggerodebothome</i> (YDK53). Occasionally the word was abbreviated: 1543 <i>Arthur Key hath given … one parcel of ground … in eschaunge for the tachement of oone milne damme</i> in Rowley (YDK56). The verb was employed less often but in 1581 an agreement between Thomas Pilkington of Bradley and John Armytage of Kirklees, whose lands lay on opposite sides of the river Calder, gave the latter the right of <i>erectinge, buyldinge, annexing, attaching and affixing of a dam or dames … for one milne or more milnes</i> (KM431).

average,averidge,averish,,,,,," A regional word of uncertain origin. In 1534 there was a dispute in York about <i>the averege</i> that the common people of the city claimed in Bishopfield from Michaelmas to Lady Day; that is over the winter period (YRS106/169). This was explained by the editor as ‘service done by a tenant with his beasts of burden’, but it seems more likely that it referred to rights of pasturage in the field once the corn had been harvested, possibly from Latin <i>averia</i>; that is cattle. The word was said to be still in everyday use in parts of north Yorkshire in the nineteenth century, and it occurs at regular intervals in documents that had to do with common pasturing rights. In some of these cases the references seem to be to the grass itself. In 1668, for example, Ralph Dewsberry of Acomb was fined 1<i>s</i> 6<i>d for letting his oxen go in the averidge</i> (YRS131/171): in the East Riding village of Lund, in 1734, it was ordered that <i>none shall break the averarge</i> [sic] <i>with cows or gelt cattle till the corn be inn’d</i>, under pain of 2s 6d (YRS69/99). What may be an earlier reference has an unusual spelling: 1482 <i>make thar perambulacon in the averer tym and yf tha found not opyn the gayts of the garth tha wold brek them opyn</i>, York (YRS98/63). Note: 1281 ‘there are small herbages after the corn and hay are carried which are called <i>Averinge</i>’, Cottingham (YRS12/240); 1641 <i>none shall keepe any geese from the third of May until Averish tyme</i>, Burton Agnes (YRS74/93).",,YRS106/169,,1534,York,YRS131/171,,1668,Acomb,YRS98/63,,1482,York,YRS12/240,,1281,Cottingham,YRS74/93,"DDGB/1/2/5/1 Burton Agnes Book of pains and orders, 1632-1710 (ERA)",1641,Burton Agnes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
average gate ,,,,,,, The rights that tenants had to ‘average’ were grazing rights subject to customary practice.," The common pastures were divided into a number of gates that corresponded to the number of animals allowed in the grazing area. These rights could belong to a particular house: 1670 <i>common of pasture and averidge to the said messuage belonging</i>, Thirsk (NRQS4/169). In 1656 a property purchased in the north Yorkshire village of Danby gave the new owner <i>fifteen averish gates and a halfe</i> in a pasture called the Lawnds. In Lealholme, in 1724, the divisions were called <i>averidge gates or foggates and eatage </i>(MD34).",edish; fog; gate (2),NRQS4/169,,1670,Thirsk,MD34,,1724,Lealholme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
avoid ,,,,,,,," We are familiar now with this word in the sense of ‘to keep away from’ a person or place, and not in the sense of ‘to make void or empty, to remove’. Formerly, however, the latter meanings were very common and there are sixteenth-century texts in which the word was used specifically in connection with the removal of water. In 1523, for example, it was recommended that 'a great dyche be dug in order that the water may auoyde' (OED). In coal-mining the word frequently occurs with this sense where there were drainage problems. In Cortworth, in 1486, the miners were required to dig channels so that <i>the water may lyghtly avoid</i> (YAJ12/237), and in North Bierley, in 1659, such channels were described as <i>watergates for avoydinge of water</i> (MM/A/255). In a deed dated 1549 Anthony Hamond of Scarthingwell sold 100 acres of spring woods in Bradley, near Huddersfield, to Thomas Beaumont and his partners. They were to<i> avoyde the seyd woodes offe the grownde and out of the lordeshyppe within … thre yeres. </i> In the first year they were allowed to have their charcoal pits in the woods and access to them for felling but must then <i>wayve and avoyde them in other ij of the next yeres </i>(WBD/8/60). Similar instructions are found in nineteenth-century mining leases.

In 1676 cutlers’ marks were granted to 34 <i>awlbladesmiths</i> on their admission to the company (HCC82). The occupation continued to be mentioned in Sheffield documents and <i>15 Awl Blade Makers</i> were listed in the trade directory of 1822. It was not uncommon from the sixteenth century for 'an awl' to be mistakenly written as 'a nall' which suggests that some clerks were not familiar with the term, n.b. 1655 <i>Thomas Ryles of Sheffeld nallbladesmith</i> (PR3/197).

The meaning soon expanded, and from <i>c</i>.1400 it readily came to refer also to any bar on which a wheel could turn, particularly one made of iron for a grindstone: 1541 <i>my gryndinge stones … with all the axiltreis and crookes</i>, Halifax (Clay154). The frequent references to iron axle-trees in the cutlers’ records are linked to the possession of water-powered grindstones: in 1547 Richard King mentioned in his will an <i>axiltree of yron</i> at Thomas Hobson’s of Wadsley Bridge, which he passed on to his son, whilst other property which included his <i>wheile</i> was bequeathed to his wife (WPS11). In 1639 William Nailor of Ecclesall was accused of stealing <i>six dozen of knives, value 2s, two pieces of iron called axiltrees and two other pieces of iron called hammers, value 6s</i> (YRS54/216). When a filesmith called Joseph Brammall died in 1698 the contents of his smithy included <i>two grinding stones with their axletrees</i> (FBH119). The term is usually found in contexts which emphasise the importance of this item to the cutler-grinders. In 1631-2, William Blithe had <i>att Heeley Wheele … an axletree, a pair of spindles, a trough, a little stithy, a paire of bellowes, 2 paire of tongs and 6 loads of stones</i> valued at £5 (WPS176).",,SS64/373,,1485,Ripon,Kaner55,"Will of Thomas Hodgeson, South Cave, 1558, South Cave Peculiar (BIA)",1558,South Caven,Clay154,,1541,Halifax,WPS11,,1547,Wadsley Bridge,YRS54/216,,1639,Ecclesall,FBH119,,1698,[Sheffield],WPS176,,1631-2,Heeley Wheele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

back ,,,,,,, In connection with tanning the OED defines this as ‘the thickest and best-tanned hide’.," That meaning seems implicit in the first example quoted there, from the Act of 1535: ‘or any leather called backs or sole leather’.

Eventually, no doubt, anything drawn up the shaft could be banked, including the coal. This seems to be the inference in 1754 when Enoch Newhouse of Beeston was paid six shillings <i>for banking 6 days</i> (DB129/4). In Northumberland and Durham, to ‘bank out’ was to empty the corves in which the coal had been drawn up.

In other words it was an agreed area in which all the waste could be stacked and the coal stored prior to its sale. The right to store coal at the pit head was not new but the right to deposit the waste, if only for the duration of the lease, seems to mark a change in attitudes to land use, placing emphasis on industry rather than agriculture.

This placed him between the <i>barrower of coals</i> who earned 6d and the <i>collyer</i> with 10d. The description of the banksman simply as a drawer-up of coals partly obscures his role and significance. Elsewhere, for instance, the banksman was described more explicitly as an overlooker (OED) or a steward (Jenn314), and the historic importance of his job is that he acted between the colliers and the mine operator.

barge  ,,,,,,,,"The OED has references from <i>c</i>.1300 which identify one type of barge as a sea-going vessel with sails. These would be different from the barges on inland waterways which were flat-bottomed and used principally for freight. Selby Abbey had such a boat from the early fifteenth century, and entries in an abbey account roll indicate that it had a crew of two or three men and that it moved heavy loads over quite long distances, even along marshy waterways into Lincolnshire: 1411-2 <i>Et in servicio duorum hominum cum Roberto Bird navigancium bargeam domini cum lapidibus de Selby usque Stalyngburgh xxd</i> (YRS118/40). In the 1440s there was a dispute between York and St Mary’s Abbey about fishgarths in the Ouse, and surviving documents contain additional information about this type of craft. It was used by the Mayor and others for several voyages down the river to Blacktoft, with stops at places such as Selby, Howden and Cawood: 1444-5 <i>solutum pro ciphis, salo et clavibus emptis apud Ebor’ pro nave vocata le Barge. </i>Other entries include: <i>j rodir pro nave vocata le Barge; j panno conducto pro coopertura navis vocate le Barge </i>(SS192/44-6). The rudder suggests how the boat was steered and the cloth canopy was a partial protection against the weather. In 1478 a new barge was ordered to be built in York, in response to <i>the King’s Commission</i> … <i>for to seirch the Ryvers of Ouse, Wherff, Ayre, etc. </i>and we have details of the timber required: <i>The parcells of the stuff yevyn to the said barge filoweth</i> [sic] … <i> a greit tre to a botham tree and three other treis, and a half hundredth of clift burde</i> (YRS98/28).

He is likely to have been moving stone, for an important staithe at Kettleman Bridge in Tadcaster served to link Huddleston quarry to York: <i>soluti custodi dominii de Grymeston juxta Tadcastre pro stallagio lapidum apud Ketilmyrebrygg </i>(SS35/34).

In 1682, Mr Pilkington’s workmen were stripping bark in Bradley Wood when a body of armed men attacked them: the trespassers took away <i>the barke which was pilled </i>and then helped themselves to the men’s ladders and <i>pilled severall Barkes of the trees and carried the same away</i> (QS1).",pill,SS128/167,,1476,York,SS186/219,,1500,York,SS106/110,,1540,Whitby,QS1,,1682,Bradley Wood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

barker  ,,,,,,,In the northern counties the ‘barker’ was the man who stripped the bark from oak trees for the tanner and by association the term then came to be applied to the tanner himself.," As a by-name it is on record from the twelfth century and it became a popular surname. Early examples include 1301 <i>John le Barker</i> of Snape and <i>Ralph le Barker</i> of Bedale (YRS21/101-2). Independent references to the occupation are recorded from the same century: 1379 <i>William Cook, barker,</i> of Flockton (PTWR); 1501 <i>Robert Kettlewell, barker </i>of Ripon (YRS102/102). An account roll for Whitby Abbey illustrates the dual role with the following entries: 1395 <i>De Willelmo Barker, pro bark sibi vend’o in les Holmes 6s 8d; Pro pellibus animalium venditis Will. Barker</i> (SS72/564-5). In 1538 it was ordered at the manor court of Wakefield that <i>no barker by any heir </i>[buy any hair]<i> of his nebor</i> – the reason being that clothiers were blending it with wool to make a cloth <i>callyd pawmpillzon</i> (WCR9/86). The work of the tanner certainly overlapped with that of the barker but a distinction between the two is explicit in a deposition of 1691 in which a man called George Harrison said that he earned <i>9d a day all this barke time, for chopping of barke, besides working of the tanner traid </i>(NRQS9/8).",,YRS21/101,,1301,Snape,YRS21/102,,1301,Bedale,PTWR,,1379,Flockton,YRS102/102,,1501,Ripon,,,1395,Whitby,WCR9/86,,1538,,NRQS9/8,,,np,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SS72/564-5,Wakefield,1691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inventory of a Selby tanner who died in 1673 valued four loads of <i>bark in the bark house </i>at £6 13s 4d (YRS47/33). However, wills of the sixteenth century make it clear that leather was also stored in the bark house, and other documents associate the building more closely with the tan-house itself. In 1551, for example, Robert Croft of Collingham willed that his son should <i>have and occupie his stoke of ledder in the barke howse </i>(Th19/288) and a Fountains Abbey lease of 1532 lists <i>seisterns, fattes, towbes and all odre vessels to the … barkhouse belonging for tanning </i>(YRS140/241).",bark sack,YRS50/158,,1330,East Ayton,SS72/561,,1395,Whitby,MD225/1/216,,1491,Hipperholme,YRS47/33,,1673,Selby,,,1551,Cottingham,YRS140/241,,1532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Th19/288,Fountains Abbey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these were items in farming inventories, at a time when corves not barrows were commonly used in coal-pits.

bass  ,,,,,,,"A spelling of ‘bast’, the inner bark of the lime, which could be cut into strips and coarsely plaited to make matting (OED).  It was used more generally for similar fibres. ","In Yorkshire, particularly in Beverley, it was the word used for the rushes which were harvested each year in the town’s common pastures. In November 1755, the bellman announced that freemen had the liberty to cut up <i>Carr Basses</i> in Figham Carr at any time in the approaching winter and in 1787 reference was made to the <i>Basshills</i> in Figham. The practice was responsible for a verb, and in November 1803 the bellman’s cries gave way to handbills which advertised the <i>bassing</i> of Swinemoor, inviting tenders (YRS122/87). It was a practice with a much longer history and it is unlikely that it was confined to Beverley. Once the bass had been harvested it was used to make matting, baskets, chairs: 1589 <i>First 2 tubbes, a bass, a bill a pick pann</i>, South Cave (Kaner156); 1613-4 <i>a forme a binche a basse</i>, South Cave (Kaner251); 1634 <i>2 painted cloths and a basse</i>, Elmswell (DW235); 1764 <i>a bas bottomed chair,</i> Ecclesfield (EDH24).

battlement ,,,,,,, Associated generally with the parapets of buildings such as castles and churches.," 1437 <i>Pro le Batyllyng turris ... infra Castrum de Skipton</i> (Whit2/323); 1443 <i>ad facturam unius batilmentt super ecclesiam</i>, York (SS30/89). Also used occasionally of a crenelated brim of a cup or bowl: 1444 <i>j stantem peciam coopertam cum bend in medio et batilment deaurato</i>, Beverley (SS30/103). Regionally, though, it was the the usual word for bridge parapets, although I have found no reference to this usage elsewhere. One of the earliest examples is in a contract of 1579 which required the mason who was responsible for the rebuilding of Elland Bridge to construct <i>the batilments of well hewen stones one yeard in Height</i> (HAS35). The bridge would later serve as a model for other stone bridges in the district, and similar instructions are found in later contracts. In 1702, a bridge over the River Laver, between Studley and Ripon, was to have <i>an arch of fourteen yards</i> and <i>battlements … one yard above the pavement</i> (QS1/40/4): the space between the battlements was to measure ten feet. At Downham, in 1705, the arch was to be twelve yards long, and three yards were to be allowed <i>between the battlements </i>(QS1). Similarly, Buckden Bridge had also to be <i>3 yards wide within the Battlements</i> in 1689 (QS1). The importance attached to this width reflects the need to allow sufficient space for carts to pass on the bridge. Three yards may seem inadequate but there is evidence that carts in south Yorkshire could be no more than 3 feet 6 inches wide in the eighteenth century. There are several incidental but illustrative references to this term, and the frustrated petition of one freemason in 1697 is worth quoting in full. He had, he claimed:</b><i>  … been putt to losse and damage five severall times by having the batlements of Horbury Bridge throwne down into the water, which he had cramped with irone and leade, and … hath beene at cost and charges for setting severall stones upon the said bridge to keepe waines and cartes from comeing to neare the battlements </i>(QS1).</b>On the same theme<i> The Leeds Mercury</i> of 5 October 1731 carried the following notice:</b><i>Whereas the Battlement of Shipscar-Bridge, about Ten Yards in Length, was on Wednesday Morning, being the 22nd of September last, thrown down and the Cramps broke by some disorderly Persons … any Person who can discover the Offenders so that they may be brought to Punishment, shall have Ten Shillings Reward </i>(Th24/94)",,Whit2/323,,1437,Skipton,SS30/89,,1443,York,SS30/103,,1444,Beverley,HAS35,,1579,Elland,,,1702,River Laver,QS1,,Downham,,QS1,,,Buckden Bridge,QS1,,1697,Horbury,Th24/94,,1731,Shipscar-Bridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,QS1/40/4,1705,1689,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bawson  ,,,,,,,,"Bawson Cliffe is a Gomersal place-name. It is listed by A.H.

The earliest spellings that I have noted are <i>Bawsoncliff</i> in 1580 (DD/HS) and <i>Bawsincliffe</i> in 1690 (MD292). Bawson is not an obscure word for it was an alternative name for the badger, first noted in the OED as early as <i>c</i>.1325. The references quoted there make the identification quite clear: in 1496, for example, we have ‘a brok or a bawsym’ and in 1587 ‘the balstone or the grey’. Both ‘brock’ and ‘grey/gray’ were alternative words in England for the badger, and ‘brock’ is a common element in minor place-names such as Brockholes and Brockstones. Although ‘bawson’ has an Old French origin there is no evidence that it was used in France as a word for a badger. It meant piebald and was used of animals that had white spots or stripes on a bay or black background. In England there are references from the early 1300s when a horse could be described as <i>bausand </i>because of its colouring.

The following confirms that meaning: 1605 <i>quod obtundit et verberavit x pecias panni linnei </i>(<i>Anglice did beame ten webbes of lynnen cloth</i>), Thirkleby (NRQS1/9).

beck ,brook,,,,,, A stream.," It is often said that beck is the usual word in those parts of England which were settled by Scandinavians, but the evidence in Yorkshire indicates that in some regions it was used as an alias for ‘brook’ quite late in place-name history: 1526 <i>oon beke or brooke called Ryngheybeke</i>, Farnley (YRS120/); 1537 <i>the brook or beck</i>, Calverley (DBB/5/8/176). In a boundary description for Hunsworth in 1787 the word ‘brook’ has a line drawn through it and ‘beck’ written above (DD/SR). Indeed, the place-name evidence shows that ‘beck’ successfully ousted ‘brook’ in some cases: for example, the stream that is now generally referred to as Fenay Beck, near Almondbury, was Fenay Brook for much of its history: 1502 ‘a stream called <i>Fyneybroke</i>’ (WBD/7/11). The surname Brook is predominantly a west Yorkshire surname (GRDict).

beer-brewer  ,,,,,,,,"Although ‘beer’ is a word on record in Old English its etymology is uncertain. It was used much later of the alcoholic liquor flavoured with hops which began to compete with ‘ale’, the traditional English drink. The OED has references of 1529 and 1542 which link beer with Dutchmen and the first date quoted for ‘beer-brewer’ is 1465. However, the Yorkshire evidence takes it back to the early years of that century and almost all the names of beer-brewers recorded, in a variety of east-coast locations, are obviously those of Dutchmen, e.g. 1416 <i>Florencius Janson, berebrewer</i>, York; 1423 <i>Jacobus Garardson, berebrewer</i>, York (SS96); 1493 <i>Cornelius Arteson</i>, Scarborough; 1503 <i>Brand Adrianson</i>, Hull  (YRS6). It served as a surname in the latter part of that period, no doubt given to men from the Low Countries where surnames were less well established: 1490-1 <i>the shippe of Henry Berebrewer</i>, York (YRS103/64); 1520 <i>Arthur Berebruer</i>, Hull (SS79/117-8). The hops which gave beer its distinctive flavour are mentioned in English sources from <i>c.</i>1440 but earlier references seem likely to turn up, especially where there is east-coast evidence for imports.

bind (2),binder,,,,,,". It is best known as a term in hedging, where a ‘binder’ was a pliable branch or rod, usually of hazel, one which served to secure the wooden fence stakes."," In this sense it is on record from 1642, although figuratively on that occasion: the verb has been noted from 1523. The OED defines 'binder' as a binding piece of wood or timber in carpentry but the earliest evidence quoted is in an architectural glossary of 1842. Numerous references in bridge-building are in contexts where the meaning is not absolutely clear: in 1682, the carpenters working on Bolton Bridge used the phrase <i>binding and other wright worke</i>, which might point to the use of timber, whereas a later entry for <i>three Cartfull of Hasells for binding the waer</i> clearly means hazel rods for the weir (QS1). Harrison quotes from an undated document for Bideford Bridge in which a platting of hazel formed ‘a kind of basket’ that served to hold stakes together which were part of a starling. In 1699, the carpenter’s bill for Tadcaster Bridge contained charges <i>For long streakers and cross Binders 174 ft at 12d per ft</i>. This was in a sequence of entries that had to do with trestles and the centre for the arch (QS1/39/1). In 1747, the word was similarly used in connection with the construction of the centre; that is <i>For sawing the wood and binding the sintrees, </i>Clapham(QS1/86/5). In 1717 <i>rice and bindings</i> for Hewick Bridge again seems to refer to hazel rods: the ‘rice’ was rise or brushwood (QS1/56/6).",,QS1,,1682,Bolton Bridge,QS1/39/1,,1699,Tadcaster,QS1/86/5,,1747,Clapham,QS1/56/6,,1717,Hewick Bridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bladesmith ,,,,,,,," The earliest examples of ‘blade’ were recorded in the Old English period and they referred to the leaves of plants or to the broad, flattened part of an instrument or tool. In this latter sense the blade was distinct from the shank or handle, and it was evidently considered to be leaf-like: it was used particularly of a paddle or oar but occurred also in connection with weapons or knives. It is on record from <i>c</i>.1325 and some sixty years later Chaucer’s ‘rusty blade’ was a sword. The ‘bladesmith’ was the metal worker who made such blades and the occupational term occurs from <i>c.</i>1400 (OED). As a surname, but not necessarily hereditary, it can be found earlier in the rolls of York freemen: 1357 <i>Nich. Bladsmith</i>; 1394 <i>Joh. Bladesmyth de Stayngate</i>’ (SS96) and in Doncaster: 1369 <i>Henry Bladesmyth</i> (YRS52/139). The occupational term occurred independently: 1375 <i>Johannis de Wathen, bladesmyth</i>, Hull (SS89/267); 1449 <i>Hugh Calcotes, bladesmyth</i>, York (YRS6/31); 1501 <i>Laurence Ryder, bladsmyth,</i> York (YRS6/142). The inference is that such ‘blades’ were for weapons, probably daggers and swords, since cutlers and bladesmiths were in the same guild in York. However, a reference in York to <i>bladesmythes that makes cutler ware</i> in 1488 shows that it was not always the case (YRS103/36). In the Ordinances of the Sheffield cutlers in 1565 it was ordered <i>that no bladesmythe … shall sell no maner of blades to no dagger maker</i> (HCC2). The word is found occasionally in Sheffield as an occupation: 1698 <i>Robertus fil’ Roberti Sands bladesmith</i>, Sheffield (PR4/169).",,SS96,,1357,York,SS96,,1394,York,YRS52/139,,1369,Doncaster,SS89/267,,1375,Hull,,,1449,York,YRS6/142,,1501,,YRS103/36,,,Yprl@HCC2,1565,,Sheffield,PR4/169,1698,,Sheffield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,YRS6/31,York,1488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
blanch farm   ,,,,,,,,"This term has an Old French origin, and was no doubt brought here by the Normans. The examples of its use that are quoted in reference works date only from the early 1600s, but Latin equivalents such as <i>redditus albus</i> and <i>alba firma</i> show that it was current from the Middle Ages. In York, payment was made in 1500 <i>pro firma diversarum terrarum … vocata Blauncheferm </i>(SS192/200): the literal meaning ‘white rent’ is said to have described payment in silver, as opposed to payment in kind or through services. That may not have been the case in 1535, when the rent of certain lands held by Fountains Abbey was one ‘mark’. There was no coin worth a mark but the noble or half mark was a gold coin. The entry reads <i>domino Regi pro blaunch ferme xiijs iiijd</i> (SS42/258). </b>The irony is that the meaning of blanch farm may have been changing just as the first examples of the English term are on record. In 1680, for example, there was a debate about certain rents and services due to the lord of Woolley manor: a tenant called Roger Clarke was reported as saying that he had heard that <i>the meaning of the words Blanche-farme and Grene-hue is that every farmer is allowed to take radlins for the thatching and mortering of their houses, for which they pay … the sum of 7d yearly</i> (YAJ27/284). In Scotland blanch farm is said to have been a nominal quit rent, sometimes as a white rose, a pair of gloves or even spurs. In a set of accounts for Brandsby, from 1609, the estate owner referred frequently to his <i>blansh farm or wepentack fyne</i> (NYRO44).",,SS192/200,,1500,York,SS42/258,,1535,Fountains Abbey,YAJ27/284,,1680,Woolley manor,NYRO44,,1609,Brandsby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By then it was also being used of the wrought iron produced in the finery hearth at the forge (CAM/36).  Early Yorkshire references include: 1352 <i>vynt quatre blomes</i>, Creskeld (Th41/301); 1395 ‘rendering for the wood 8d for every <i>12 blumhes</i>’, Arthington (YRS63/71).

He did however say that freshly-quarried sandstones can be off-white to grey-blue and that a rock known as ‘Bluestones’ occurred near Keighley, although he considered this to be unsuitable for mill-stones. It may be, of course, that ‘blue stones’ had become a sort of generic, inspired by awareness of the high-quality blue stones quarried in Germany.

boon,boon-day,booner,boon-hen,boon-load,boon-loaf,boon-work,,"The word ‘boon’ is of Norse origin and has an interesting semantic history. It formerly meant ‘prayer’, but very quickly came to be associated with the granting of the prayer, and by extension acquired the meaning of ‘favour’. The thing asked for eventually became the thing freely given. It retained something of this sense in the manorial system, where ‘boons’ were services, owed by tenants to the lord of the manor. In fact these services were actually obligations, a condition of their tenure of the land, and they could take the form of unpaid labour, carriage or ‘gifts’. In a sense they were part and parcel of the manor, and therefore transferable. In 1595, when Thomas Crompton leased Friarhead in Flasby to James Best, the agreement included certain rents and <i>all the bounes belonging to</i> the messuage (MD74-75). Because most of the early documents that relate to the manor were in Latin, the first English references to ‘boons’ are comparatively late, certainly much later than the origins of the custom. However, from the mid-1400s the word occurs quite frequently, mostly in connection with labour on the land, either in the preparation of the soil or the harvesting of the crops: 1442 <i>sekilbones, ploghbones</i>, Fixby (YRS63/37); 1532 <i>bownes with sythe and sekyll and rayke</i>, Aldfield (YRS140/247). Less usual were those which had to do with woodland clearance and carriage: 1537<i> stubbyng bowne, or 2d rent,</i> Wibsey (LRS2/62); 1499 <i>bownes … such as carienge of wodde and heye</i>, Marsden (DD/R/dd/30). In a rare agreement in 1592 the tenant of land at Hackness accepted responsibility for the preservation of the deer and the carriage each year of two <i>boane loades</i> of timber from the woods in the lordship (YRS69/49).</b>Such services were usually measured in days, and ‘boon days’ is a common term in sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century documents: 1592 <i>duos precarios vocatos boinne dayes</i>, Dewsbury (YAJ21/466); 1595 <i>one boyne day mowinge and one boyne daie shearinge</i>, Blubberhouses (YRS50/45). In Settrington in 1599-1600 a survey of the manor listed the underwood of eight ‘haggs’ under the heading <i>Le Bonedayes</i> of the manor (YRS126/27). In a set of accounts for work carried out on the quay in Bridlington in 1544, two entries suggest that repairs were done as ‘boons’ and that food supplied to the workmen was obtained at special rates, that is at the <i>boune day price.</i> On that occasion, the fare consisted of <i>3 kyderkyns of bere</i> and <i>3 dussen of men bread</i> (YRS80/70). </br> Other services were apparently paid in kind, more like tithes, e.g. 1574<i> henne boynes,</i> Shepley (KM364); 1582 <i>boyne hens</i>, East Morton (YRS50/136). The strange thing is that such services could at some stage be divided, perhaps a reflection on the history of the tenure of the land in question. So, in 1571, we find the tenant of Brockholes in Thurstonland responsible for <i>two sekel boynes and towe partes of two hennes and two capones</i> (YDK75). Amongst the papers at Woolley Hall, with a date of 1680, is <i>A Rentall of Henns and Capons ... due at Easter</i>, with details of <i>Boon draughts for plowing ... Leading of Lyme yearly ... Harrowing </i>and<i> Shearing </i>(YAJ27/283-4).</b>Eventually tenants began to find these obligations irksome, and disruptive of their own farming practices. One way round the problem was to replace the boons with money payments, and that practice may have been in operation from a very early date: 1280 <i>the foresters of the Earl … had not puture, corn in autumn, bonepeny or anything else from the tenants</i>, Kirkby Overblow (YRS12/211). The alternatives are clearly expressed in a North Bierley deed of 1537, in which the tenant had the option of providing the lord with <i>one half ploghebone or 3d rent, and one half seculebone or 1d rent</i> (LRS2/5) and the changing situation is explicit also in the accounts of Richard Cholmeley who held the manor of Brandsby: in 1602 he wrote <i>the tenants do geve me bone dayes in hey time</i>, whereas in 1614 he noted a payment of 6d from a woman called Cecile Addyson <i>in lew of her boone day</i> (NYRO44).</b> In more recent times, when the landlord might also be a mine-owner, the services could be in work performed at a colliery, not on the land, as at Tong in 1761, where there is mention of <i>leading wood to pitt Boon work </i>(Mss4c/6). Entries such as <i>Hall a boone</i> and <i>bonners to Hall</i> in Farnley, in 1711-2, may refer to coal supplied by colliers to the hall as part of their right to work a pit (MS14). Some Skipton leases granted by the Cliffords in 1604 required the tenant to convey a sack of coal from Colne to Skipton Castle, a distance of twelve miles (YAJ64/158). There is evidence of similar ‘booning’ practices in Colsterdale, Silsden, Methley and Whitley. At Woolley Hall a rental of 1680 recorded <i>Boon Draughts for Leading of Lyme</i> (YAJ27/284). </b>No doubt the changes were different from one manor to another and it is difficult to generalise about the decline of traditional boon days and boon payments, but the word was occuring much less commonly by the middle of the seventeenth century. One late usage, in 1754, appears to reflect the changes that had taken place and a return in meaning to the idea that a boon was a favour. On this occasion the inhabitants of Almondbury township were involved in a dispute about the repair of a lane that crossed into the neighbouring territory. They maintained that the lane did not have highway status but was merely a by-way and, therefore, they had no obligation to repair it. They acknowledged that they had carried out some repairs, but only as <i>booners</i> (DT305/1/25/2). Now, of course, a boon is a benefit or advantage that we enjoy freely, perhaps unexpectedly.",,MD74-75,,1595,Flasby,YRS63/37,,1442,Fixby,YRS140/247,,1532,Aldfield,LRS2/62,,1537,Wibsey,,,1499,Marsden,YRS69/49,,1592,,YAJ21/466,,,Dewsbury,YRS50/45,,1595,Blubberhouses,YRS126/27,,1599-1600,Settrington,BCP,,1544,Bridlington,KM364,,1574,Shepley,YRS50/136,,1582,East Morton,DD/R/dd/30,Hackness,1592,YDK75,1571,Brockholes in Thurstonland,Almondbury,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bore  ,,,,,,,,"Men were <i>boring for Coals</i> in Sharlston in <i>c</i>.1600, in a commercial enterprise (GSH2), and in 1636 John Kaye <i>sought for coals in Rowley and found them for the use of his howse at Woodsome</i> (KayeCP); that is as domestic fuel. ‘Seeking’ for coal in an area where other coal-pits were already being worked would require an owner to employ men who would make a bore-hole, partly to determine the nature of the ground they were working through, whether it was rocky or wet for example, but also to learn at what depth the coal lay and how thick the coal-bed might be. The operation was described in detail in <i>The Compleat Collier</i> (1708):</b></b> ‘We have two labourers at a time, at the handle of the bore Rod, and they chop, or pounce with their Hands up and down to cut the Stone or Mineral, going round, which of course grinds either of them small, so that finding your Rod to have cut down four or six Inches, they lift up the Rod, either all at once, as there is conveniency for its Lift; or by Joynts, fixing the Key, which is to keep the Rod from droping down into the hole’ (CC3-4).</b>About three inches in diameter was deemed sufficient for such a bore-hole and local colliery accounts refer briefly to the process: 1633 <i>boring with wimble for searching for coal</i>, Halifax (HAS31/78); 1762 <i>Joseph Cowburn 5 days at 1s 4d boring 6s 8d</i>, Tong (Mss4c/6); 1833 <i>the best scourse </i>[sic]<i> viz that of Boring</i>, Birstall (DD/CA/5).

Explicit information dates from 1692 when a new set of rods was ordered in Colsterdale: they were to be 16 fathoms long, <i>with boxes and pins with one yard between every joint … also half a yard and a three quarters rod and a foot rod and three braces for tops … one dozen and a half chizzels, two womble shells, two keys and a screw tapp</i> (BM82/39).",bore; tools; implements,HAS32/282,,1816,Halifax,BAS10/252,,1600-1615,np,BM82/39,,1692,Colsterdale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1697 Edward Creswick had <i>boreing stoops</i> in his Work Chamber and other examples have been noted in 1724 and 1730 (IH). Unfortunately the word is missing from the OED and its precise meaning remains uncertain although the repeated references to ‘pairs’ of boring stoops and the fact that one cutler had six pairs may rule out the possibility that the ‘stoop’ was a substantial block of wood or stone. Since the use of the ‘device’ coincides with the emergence of hafting as a specialised craft it may have been an apparatus for boring out knife handles (CAT36). Alternatively it may have been connected with the making of rivets since, in 1724, Samuel Taylor had in his Work Chamber <i>4 Visses 4 revitting Stithys 3 pair of booring Stoops 3 revitting hammers </i>(IH).

boulder  ,,,,,,,,"The OED definition of this word is ‘a rounded stone … larger than a pebble’ but the earliest example quoted is from 1617 when it was used of paving stones: it was compared to ‘some other kind of small stone’.

We are now more familiar with boulder as a word for a large block of stone but there are no examples of it used in this way from before 1800, so its premier definition may be at first surprising. Nevertheless, in bridge-building accounts it clearly referred to what we would now describe as cobbles, as in 1675 when the workmen responsible for Ilkley Bridge claimed £4 6s 0d for <i>Leading of Fillinges and Boulders for paveing the Bridge</i> (QS1/14). Similarly, in 1682, George Holgate was paid for <i>leading boulders and sand </i>for Rotherham Bridge (QS1). It may be significant that Boulder Bridge occurs twice as a place-name in south Yorkshire, in Carlton and Hoyland Swaine. The latter was spelt <i>Buldirbrig</i> in 1495 (SS53/101).

bray  ,,,,,,,"To grind into small pieces, as in a mortar; to beat."," Many early examples make reference to a mortar, as in the will of the vicar of Osbaldwick in 1557.

Also: 1570 <i>two braying morters and two pestelles</i>, Spaldington (YRS134/39).</b>Less precisely it had the meaning of to beat, in various trades and crafts, and the OED notes its use in the preparation of hemp and flax, and the scouring of wool. The ordinances of the skinners in York add to that list, for in 1500 their practices included an item <i>for 1000 graywarke wanyng and braying </i>at a cost of 2s (SS186/221). Several West Riding accounts show that the word was regularly used for stone-breaking in the repair of the local roads. In Honley, for example, in 1778, 42 yards of road had <i>to be stoned and well brayed </i>(CP/HO) and there was an entry in the farming accounts of a South Crosland farmer in 1845 for <i>Stones braying and laying on </i>(GRD). Both these meanings have been noted from the fourteenth century.</b>The OED also notes that the word could mean to beat or thrash a person, but with just one reference, from 1808 in Cumberland: it is classed there and in the EDD as a northern dialect usage. The Yorkshire evidence is earlier and seems to trace its development directly from the first meaning. In 1708, a Kettlewell man claimed that an attacker <i>struck at him and said that he would bray him as smaill as sand</i> (QS1). In 1747 George Brooke of Braithwell wrote a letter about debts and rents which he owed, and expressed the fear that he might be physically assaulted, saying <i>I should be very sorry … to fall into the hands of one that would Bray me to pieces </i>(MD44). </b>It is one of a small number of dialect terms that survive in everyday use and it can still be printed in local newspapers without the need for editorial comment.

breed  ,,,,,,,"The verb to breed has developed numerous shades of meaning but is most commonly used to describe the bringing forth of offspring, the propagation of the species."," In connection with animals we say a farmer raises or breeds a particular kind of cattle or sheep. By analogy it has come to have the more general senses of ‘bring into existence, produce and give rise to’, so that we might speak of poverty breeding despair or resentment, or comfort breeding complacency. </b>In husbandry it was used formerly in the neighbourhood of Huddersfield to describe the production of manure by domestic animals, particularly those which were 'folded' by the farmer. In <i>c</i>.1570, Mr Kaye of Woodsome Hall advised his son not to let his cattle or horses into the pasture grounds at certain times of the year, but to <i>sele them upp to brede … mucke </i>(KayeCP). To ‘sele’ in this sense was to fasten the animals securely in their stalls.</b>This approach was an essential aspect of farming in late medieval times: the commodities produced on the manor were not to be exploited commercially and not to be sold to neighbours, but ‘husbanded’ and put to their best use locally. So a farmer’s lease in 1651 required him to feed or use for bedding <i>all the haye and strawe … gotten upon the premises … for breeding of manure </i>(WBD/3/130): a Honley lease of 1624 defined ‘breed’ for us, referring to <i>all the maynour</i> (manure)<i> or compost being brede or arising by occupation of the premises </i>(G-A). By extension the word came to be used of other fertilising agents: in Meltham, a clause in Joseph Taylor’s lease of 1735 insisted that <i>all the ashes that he might make or breed </i>during his tenancy should be spread upon the lands (MD63) and there were similar clauses in deeds for Southowram in 1783 and Addingham in 1790. Its use was not confined to the West Riding: in 1615, Richard Cholmeley of Brandsby in the North Riding wrote in his diary: <i>Manure besyd that I breede £5</i> (NYRO44/108).",fulture; manure,KayCP,,c.1570,Woodsome Hall,WBD/3/130,,1651,np,G-A,,1624,Honley,NYRO44/108,,1615,Brandsby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

bridge-house  ,,,,,,,A house situated by or close to a bridge.,"In some cases the terms on which it was held made the tenant responsible for the bridge’s maintenance and protection. The OED has examples of the word from 1375 and it may explain how some minor place-names originated. In 1701, it was ordered <i>that Martin Shillito have the little house formerly built at the charge of the Riding at Wakefield Bridge End to live in rent free provided he take care to sweep the bridge and cleanse the water spouts</i> (QS10). It is uncertain how old this tradition was but the words <i>as hath usually been done by those that have lived in the same house</i> indicate that it was already an established custom. Articles of agreement, drawn up in 1683 between the Clerk of the Peace and Daniel Sheppard, an earlier tenant, tell us more about his role. He was<i> put into possession of the new repaired house standing at the North end of Wakefield Bridge commonly called … the bridge house … during the term of his naturall life</i>. Extracts from the conditions that applied define his tasks:</b> <i>1 That he … dress Scower or cause to be dressed and Scowered the Water course, on both Sides of the said bridg, And keep open all and every of the Spouts thereunto belonging …</b>2 That he … observe and take notice, from time to time when ever any of the pavement upon any part of the said bridg, shall be cast up. And that he immeadiatly … make up or cause to be made up and repaired the said breatch.</b>3 That he … after any Flood of Water do observe and take notice … when any of the Stones commonly called Setters within any of the frames or Jewells under the bridg, chance to shrinke or fall by reason of the Washing of the gravell from under them: That so soone as he can come to the Same without danger; That he raise or cause to be raised the Same into their due place. Provided the Same So Happeing may be done in the Space of one days Worke by one man …</b>4 That he keep and maintaine the said house in Sufficent repaire during the time he shall enjoy the Same …</b>5 That he … Suffer the Surveyors appointed … for the repaire of the said bridg, to keep a stock of stones, and other Materialls necessary for the said repairs within the Seller under the said house, and that the said Surveyors … have ingress and regress, to carry into, and bring out of the said Seller such stones and other materials as they shall have use for … </i>(QS1). Other parts of the agreement stressed that the provision of new stones and other materials was to be at the charge of the West Riding; that the tenant had right to half the cellar, and that his widow, in the event of his death, would have to vacate the premises within three months, <i>to the end another Workman may be made choice of and admitted Tennant</i>. This use of the word ‘workman’ suggests that the tenant had to possess certain basic skills.

bridge-stone,brig-stone,,,,,,It was not unusual formerly for rainwater to be drained from a town street via a channel that ran between the pavement and the entrances to the houses. The stone across the channel was called a bridge-stone.," The OED has the word from 1876 but examples occur in Yorkshire from the 1600s and it will have a much longer history: 1639 <i>that ... Edward Langfield and William Beatson do scoure their ditches in Back laine and brynge yt vnder the Brigstone before William Beasons dore</i>, Ossett (WCR1/82). At the Almondbury court in 1690, Widow Akersley was ordered to <i>permit the water that runns under the Brigg stone before Thomas Beaumont’s dore in Huddersfield to pass through the ancient course</i> (DD/R/M). Some bridge-stones of this kind survive in small towns like Settle.</b>Alternatively, a single stone which crossed a narrow stream could be referred to as a bridge-stone and this term survived as a minor place-name in Lothersdale (PNWR6/32). It was also the probable origin of <i>bridgestone</i> in a Pudsey document of 1629 (WYAS631). Similar examples occurred in Tong: 1684 <i>the causey adioyneing upon the brigstone at Bentham Syke</i> (Mss 8a/25) and in Northowram, where two workmen were ordered <i>to lay a sufficient brigg-stone over the water-course running at the bottom of New Brigg Lane</i> (WCR13/110).</b>Not surprisingly, it is a word found frequently in descriptions of boundaries. In 1667, one point on the perambulation of Tong boundary was <i>the Bridgestone in the High streete divideing betweene Tonge and Bolling</i> (BAS10/128). In 1759 the Shelley perambulation began <i>at a Brigstone dividing the manor from that of Skelmanthorpe</i>. (DD181/15). An interesting order at the Quarter Sessions in 1714 required <i>certain Bridge Stones and rails … to be erected in crofts … at Apperley Bridge for Travelleres … to pass through when the River overflowed the road</i> (QS1/53/6).</b>More literally the word was used of the stones used to build a bridge. These were valuable items and would be recovered whenever possible after a bridge had collapsed. It was the masons’ task to retrieve them, and they are often referred to in accounts in the Quarter Sessions Rolls. In 1675, when Ilkley Bridge was reconstructed, one entry was for <i>getting the Old Bridge Stones out of the River </i>(QS1): in 1697, the builder at Long Preston was paid for his time <i>seekeing of Stoans in the Water </i>(QS1/37/1). The earliest reference I have noted to this practice is in the Kirkstall Bridge contract: 1619 <i>John Phillip do acknowledge to have received ... twentie two poundes for the working of stones  ... and for getting of stones oute of the water there</i> (BAS6/147).",brig-tree,WCR1/82,,1639,Ossett,DD/R/M,,1690,Almondbury,WYAS631,,1629,Pudsey,Mss 8a/25,,1629,Tong,,,,,BAS10/128,,1667,,DD181/15,,,Shelley,QS1/53/6,,1714,Apperley Bridge,QS1,,1675,Ilkley Bridge,QS1/37/1,,1697,Long Preston,BAS6/147,,1619,Kirkstall Bridge,,,,,,Tong,1759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1687, <i>bridle stieths</i> was a regional spelling in Holme (WCR13/120). The status of such rights of way was discussed at the Quarter Sessions: 1676 ‘touching a way ... leading to New Malton, whether the same were a <i>bridle-sty</i> or a common highway for cart and carriage’ (NRQS6/254). The form which we now use, that is ‘bridle-way’, was rare but it occurred as <i>bridilway</i> in Quarmby in 1439 (MD225). Combinations of the two terms are on record from the seventeenth century: 1675<i> a bridle sty highway between Wetherby and Bickerton</i> (QS1/15); 1705 <i>a bridlesty way,</i> Snydall (QS1/44/6).",sty-way,MD225,,1515,Holmfirth,TWH14/45,,1573,Ecclesall,WCR13/120,,1687,Holme,NRQS6/254,,1676,New Malton,,,,,QS1/15,,1675,,QS1/44/6,,,Snydall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wetherby, Bickerton",1705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It consisted of iron rings or thin metal plates which were sewed onto canvas or leather and then covered over, either with the same material or a finer fabric. It derives from ‘brigand’, originally a term for a lightly-armed soldier which was already being used of undisciplined freebooters by the 1420s. Gerard de Usflete of North Ferriby was possibly serving in France when he made his will in 1420: he left <i>unum par de bregaunters</i> to whichever church he might be buried in (SS4/397). The word was unusual enough to serve as a second name for a York tradesman: <i>Jacobus Brigendermaker</i> took up his freedom in the city in 1453 (SS96/174) and paid <i>pro stallagio suo</i> in 1455 (SS192/87). In fact this entry was crossed through so he may not have been trading and it seems likely that he died soon afterwards. There are administration documents for <i>James Roderyk, bregandyn maker</i>, in 1459 (YRS6/139) and this implies that his occupational by-name had previously been unusual enough to identify him.

In Jamieson's <i>Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language</i> (1808), to broach was to rough hew and this is more likely to have been the meaning in the Elland context, more especially since it is was used there of the pavement, in the same sentence that the battlements were to be <i>of well hewn stones</i>.

An arrest in the Forest of Pickering confirms how big a problem such forays were and provides an earlier reference to the word in this sense: 1489 <i>Thomas Thomson … cum aliis personis ignotis Riotosis … in media nocte … cum uno equo onerato cum retibus vocatis bukstalles et Ropes</i> (NRR1/145). Previous explanations of the term have concentrated on the use made of buckstalls by poachers but in the Coucher Book for the Forest of Pickering it is employed much earlier in a different context. In 1336, the Prior of Malton asserted his entitlement to certain liberties in the Forest, claiming that he and his men should be <i>quieti de bukstallis, tristis,</i> etc (NRR3/103). This was explained by the editor as a custom which compelled forest tenants to make an enclosure into which the deer were driven, presumably using nets of the kind described.

buttonmaker ,,,,,,,," The making of buttons is likely to have started out as a side-line for Yorkshire cutlers in the 1600s, but by the second half of the century the occupation was established independently: 1669 <i>Peter Elston, button-maker,</i> Fewston (MJ84). In the years 1685-7 three Sheffield men, John Jarvis, John Bate and John Offerton were named as button-makers in the Quarter Sessions records (FBH122) and soon afterwards the craft was recorded in the Sheffield parish register: 1698 <i>Beniam Mitchell, button maker</i>’ (PR4/168). It was a logical development, since the cutler had skills which enabled him to work not only metal but materials such as bone, horn and pearl. When Thomas Boulsover discovered how to plate copper with silver in 1743 he set up in business as a buttonmaker (FBH125).

by,byrlaw,,,,,,"  As a word of Scandinavian origin <i>b?</i> had the meaning of ‘village’ or ‘farmstead’ and as a place-name element it is popular in different parts of Yorkshire, for example Austby, Selby, Whitby."," Less familiar is its later use as a specific in compound terms where it clearly referred to the village or community. In 1390, for example, Henry Wryght and two other men were elected as the <i>bygraves</i> of Over Yeadon; that is as ‘graves’ or officers of the local court (SW89): in 1455 and 1463 there are references in Ripon to the <i>Byemillne</i> or <i>Bymilne</i> which seems certain to be the town’s corn mill (SS64/383). In Rastrick, in 1330, the <i>Birfeld</i> was the town field, a word based on the genitive of <i>b?</i> (YRS109/157): in 1331 Thomas son of Julian was indicted for allowing his cattle to graze in the <i>Birefeld</i>, contrary to the <i>Bireleghe</i>; that is ‘byrlaw’ (YRS109/169). </b>Such ‘byrlaws’ were in existence in Yorkshire and other northern counties from the thirteenth century at least. In 1298, for example, a distraint was carried out in Wakefield ‘by resolution of the whole<i> Byrrelaghe</i>’ (YRS36/48) and yet we have little direct information about how these institutions originated or how they were organised. What is clear is that Byrlaws were territories which had shared by-laws, and officers who were charged with their enforcement: their concern was with boundaries, the management of the open field, trespasses by animals, and similar matters which lay outside the jurisdiction of more important courts.</b>The meaning of ‘birlaw’ appears to change slightly over the years but in that early period it certainly described a territory and in some place-names it stabilised as a distinguishing affix: 1307 <i>the vill of Bramton birlagh</i> (YRS37/40). Other examples of its use in this way are late, first recorded in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: 1539 <i>Bradfeld-bierley</i>; 1696 <i>Melton Bierly</i> (PNWR). By that time its meaning in the everyday vocabulary may have been modified: in 1609, for example, Daniel Clayton of Crigglestone was fined <i>for goinge with his draughte</i> between two shuts or divisions of the open field <i>contrarye to a byerlawe </i>and here it seems to be synonymous with by-law (WCR11/145). Indeed, in one North Riding village in 1642 assessments were made <i>according to an ancient custom … called a Bylaw </i>(NRQS4/225).</b>The officers of the birlaw were known as byrlawmen or byrlawgraves and these terms can be compared with ‘bygrave’, referred to above. Examples have been noted over a wide area: 1432 <i>Juratores elegerunt in officium de Birlawmen</i>, Ingleby Arncliffe (OED); 1525 <i>it hath bene used of long tyme in Osborne</i> [Ouseburn] … <i>that if their were any cattal impounded … that the bierlegraves … myght delyver the catall so ympounded</i>, having precedence over the pinder (YRS41/177); 1556 <i>Thomas Wawkington … was Byerlyman of Welborne and after maid pinder</i> (YRS114/88); 1571 <i>the bylawegraves of Buckden and Starbotton</i> (AW45).",byrdale; byrdole,SW89,,1390,Over Yeadon,SS64/383,,1455,Ripon,SS64/383,,1463,Ripon,YRS109/157,,1330,Rastrick,,,,,YRS36/48,,1298,,YRS37/40,,,Bramton birlaugh,WCR11/145,,1609,Crigglestone,NRQS4/225,,1642,np,OED,,1432,Ingleby Arncliffe,YRS41/177,,1525,Ouseburn,YRS114/88,,1556,Welborne,,Wakefield,1307,AW45,1571,Buckden and Starbotton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact ‘by-set’ is on record from the 1700s in documents that had to do with mills, e.g. 1794 <i>goits, cuts, bysets, shuttles, etc</i>, Mytholmbridge (G-A). In 1782, the Honley overseers of the highways recorded getting stones <i>from a place cauld By Set or water corce betwixt Farnley and Honley</i> (CP/HO) and this hints at the word giving rise to a local place-name. In fact the earliest reference that I have noted is on the estate map of Huddersfield for 1716 where <i>Bysett Close</i> is the name of a field located between the goit of Paddock Mill and the River Colne (DD/R).",,MD292/74,,1788,Hunsworth,G-A,,1794,Mytholmbridge,CP/HO,,1782,Honley,DD/R,,1716,Huddersfield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The OED offers four meanings of ‘byword’ but none of them satisfactorily explains its use in this context. Perhaps it referred to a discussion and agreement that resulted from the ‘viewing’ of the bridge, or a written undertaking. The ‘markin’ could have been the ‘measuring’ that helped the mason arrive at his estimate. Both interpretations are speculative and the precise meaning remains uncertain.

In Tong, in 1762, the cost of the <i>cabbin shifting</i> was just 6d and the inference is that these were not substantial buildings (Mss4c/6).

call (3),caul,,,,,," The OED has an entry for ‘cauld’ or ‘caul’ as a Scottish word for a dam, for which the earliest reference is 1805. The Yorkshire word meant ‘dam’, ‘weir’ or 'weir wall' and it is on record from much earlier.","It is found frequently in bridge documents from the seventeenth century, describing structures that can could be made of either wood or stone: in 1675 the undertakers' charges for work on Ilkley Bridge included £41 5s <i>For wood for Centrees ... frames and Caules</i> (QS1); in 1739 there was a <i>stone call or wear across the river Ayre</i> at Riddlesden (MD194). The function of a ‘call’ is made clear in two references to Paythorne Bridge: in 1687 there was need for <i>a call to bee made att the west end of the bridge, 20 yards in length up the water, to keep it in its due course</i> (QS1/26) and in 1704 <i>a call or wear 5 yards in length</i> was deemed necessary <i>to secure the water from overflowing a cawsay </i>(QS1/43/5). An obscure usage occurs in connection with land granted for a water-mill in Kilnhurst: 1589 <i>to fast and binde one milne dam upon to be erected and builded of pyles, and wyndings with call hedges of the water of Done</i> (TWH14/51). Perhaps ‘hedges’ here should be ‘edges’. Occasionally ‘call’ is used as a verb, as in a Stansfield by-law of 1608 which threatened to fine William Greenwood 5s <i>iff at aney tym he call the water out off the ould cours which roneth doun to Radwell end </i>(WCR11/121). Presumably he was being warned not to build a call or dam.

cappel,,,,,,, Wright has examples of this word in the late 1800s and gives the meaning ‘a leather patch on the toe of a boot or clog’: the verb meant to mend or patch shoes.," The following earlier references support those definitions and point to a possible wider use, which may be linked with the noun ‘capping-leather’: 1642 <i>Coblers ... have nowe vjd a day and theire meate, because capping leather is soe deare</i>, Elmswell (DW149); 1674 <i>he wanted some nails to mend the cappell of his hand staff</i>, Cannon Hall (QS1); 1770 <i>shoo soald and heelespecht and 3 capils; shoes mended o’th toos and capild,</i> Meltham (GRD). Earlier still, in 1617, <i>a new caple</i> was in a list of tools <i>In the milne</i> at Ripley but the meaning is not clear (YAJ34/201). A horse could be a ‘caple’ but that meaning seems unlikely in this case.

car,,,,,,," In general a two-wheeled vehicle, used to carry heavy loads such as stone and timber."," The meaning may have differed from one region to another over the centuries: in the hilly areas, for example, it was used for loads of peat and turf.

There is still a lack of evidence for the fifteenth century but the Act of 1576 mentioned ‘cars or drags … furnished for Repairing … Highways’ (SAL6/322) and the inference is that the vehicle had changed little over that period: 1541 <i>one carre full of turfs ijd</i>, Dalton in Furness (SS26/22); 1575 <i>ij peite horse carres vjd; j carr to leade corne and haye iiijd</i>, West Burton (SS26/255).

card (1),,,,,,, An implement used for ‘teasing’ or working wool into a sliver.," In this sense the word ‘card’ derives ultimately from the Latin word for thistle, and the cards used originally in the dressing proces were teasel heads set in a wooden frame. Later the hand-cards were used in pairs and were effectively wire brushes: they have been described as having sharpened and bent iron staples set in a piece of leather, mounted on a wooden back with a handle (Crump34-5).

cast (4),,,,,,," To dig, that is to cast, or cast up earth."," These meanings have been in continuous use from the fifteenth century at least. In 1491, for example, the King ordered the citizens of York to prepare the defences of the city, including the dikes which should be <i>caste and clensed</i> (YRS103/67). It is usual to find the word in township records. In 1518, the churchwardens of St Michael, Spurriergate, York, paid 4s <i>for castyng of a gutter</i> (CCW71) and it was customary for roads, turves and peat to be ‘cast’, well into the modern period. To ‘cast up’ was also frequent. In a dispute in Shelf in 1590 a man involved in a dispute with his neighbour was ordered not <i>to cast upp any earthe to his growing wodd</i> (HM/A/96) and in 1668 a tenant was granted <i>liberty to cast up … burrows for conies</i> (MD63). The substitution of ‘throw’ for ‘cast’ is nicely pointed out in the evidence of a witness at the Quarter Sessions in 1754: he stated that he had gone <i>to Leeds to cast up clay for Michael Hanson </i>and then <i>continued throwing up clay</i> (QS1/93/4). It is less common to find ‘cast’ used as a noun in this sense but it does occur occasionally. A tenant in Normanton, in 1608, was ordered to <i>scour a dyche … and take the water through Mistrise Wilkinson fould accordinge to the ould caste</i>; that is through where the ditch had previously been dug out (WCR11/107). </br>Ditches or dikes were commonly said to be cast, casten or cast up: <i>c</i>.1530 <i>the tenauntes of Gysburne ... in tyme past cast a dych between the said xij acres and the said common</i>, Bracewell (YRS41/91); 1581 <i>one yard more to cast a dyke upon</i>, Knaresborough (SS104/143); 1617 <i>turne eastwarde by the hedge unto a caste dike, beinge a water sewer </i>(NRR1/55). In 1637, a yeoman in Sinderby was presented at the Quarter Sessions because he had encroached on the main street of the village <i>by castinge upp a ditch and setting a hedge and planting the same with young trees </i>(NRQS4/69). A similar boundary hedge divided the moor at Revey in Wibsey from the common: it was described in a lease of 1599 as <i>a castne quicksett dyke </i>(MM/A/248). The tenants of Shelley noted in 1759 that a <i>bank of casten earth … is the bounding of this manor </i>(DD181/15).

Cast iron was an alloy of iron and carbon which was run in a molten state into moulds where it cooled and hardened (CAM15/36). In articles of partnership for Barnby Furnace and Kirkstall Forge in 1676 it was agreed that <i>Mettall or cast iron (that is to say Pigges and Forge and Slitting Mill necessaries) … shall be charged at five pounds by the tun</i> (SpSt). Cast iron was not suitable for cutlery wares and the Cutlers’ Company tried to ensure that it was not so used. A by-law of 1780 noted that <i>of late divers persons have begun to make blades for forks of cast or pig iron, either alone or intermixed with wrought or forged iron or steel and casting and running the same into moulds, which blades so made have not the strength &c. of steel but have been dressed and polished so as to have the appearance of having been forged and hammered out of steel, and have been sold at as high a price as if really forged and hammered out of steel</i> (HCC13). There is evidence that the rules continued to be broken: in 1783, for example, a freeman named William Kent was charged with having sold <i>eight dozen and a half of cast metal Fork blades</i>. The case was proved and Kent paid a heavy fine (HCC21).",pig iron,YAJ62/165,,1470,Hull,YAJ36/224,,1538,Knaresborough,RW1,,1716,Conistone,SpSt,,1676,Kirkstall,HCC13,,1780,[Sheffield?],HCC21,,1783,[Sheffield?},,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

catch (1),,,,,,, A type of small boat which was in use on Yorkshire’s inland waterways from the fourteenth century at least.," In the accounts for St Leonard’s Hospital was a payment to men who had helped drag a catch down to the Ouse: 1371 <i>quandam naviculum Hospitalis vocatam le cache </i>(SS35/339) and in 1423 Archbishop Bowet’s will lists income <i>pro j cache usitat’</i>, York (SS45/81). It is in Beverley though that most early references are found with a distinction drawn in 1359 between great catches [<i>qualibet magna cach</i>] and small catches [<i>parvis cachis</i>]: in 1412 they were conveying loads of thatch, straw, hay, sand, and faggots for use in the market place, and in 1467 it was ordered that <i>caches</i> should not be made or repaired on the banks of Beverley Beck (BTD/57). In Hull, in 1464-5, when repairs were being carried out to the great north jetty at Drypool, a catch was used <i>for seven tides</i> (YRS141/98). They were used also along the east coast, for a Scarborough merchant named Peter Shilbotell made the following bequest: 1505 <i>to John my sonne j quarter of my cache callyd the Marye</i> (SS53/236). They were employed particularly though to carry goods far inland, notably plying between York and Boroughbridge. In 1476-7 William Carter <i>conveid the Corn be cache to … Burghbrig </i>(YRS98/16) and in 1578 Topcliffe chancel was repaired with lead taken in a <i>catche to Burrowe brygge</i> (SS35/117). There were shipwrights in several riverside locations, and catches were among the boats they built: in 1558 a York corn merchant left stores of wood and timber to his son, reserving sixty <i>of the best bords … for the building of a catche</i> (YRS55/223). By that time the most popular vessel on the river was the ‘keel’ but the term ‘catch’ survived in use and an entry in the Quarter Sessions rolls in 1735 mentions damage done <i>by the sinking of a boat or catch on the Ayer or Calder</i>, presumably somewhere beyond Knottingley (QS1).",ketch,SS35/339,,1371,York,SS45/81,,1423,York,BTD/57,,1359,Beverley,BTD/57,,1412,Beverley,BTD/57,,1467,Beverley,YRS141/98,,1464-5,Hull,SS53/236,,1505,Scarborough,YRS98/16,,1476-7,np,SS35/117,,1578,Topcliffe,YRS55/223,,1558,York,QS1,,1735,Knottingley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was his task <i>to fetch her water from the catch and she gave him a penny a week for that </i>(Corr.). This was the local abbreviation for catchwater, in this case one of the conduits which ran from the heights above Marsden to Blackmoorfoot Reservoir. It is a word which features regularly in the <i>The History of the Huddersfield Water Supplies</i> (1939) and by inference its history goes back to the creation of the moorland reservoirs of the early nineteenth century. These had large catchment areas which were fed by conduits several miles long. The author also used the terms ‘catchwater conduit’ and ‘catchwater drain’.

causey,,,,,,," This word had several closely related meanings which all refer to raised ways, either across low-lying land subject to flooding or at the side of tracks used by pedestrians and horses."," The causeys were in place in several towns and were an essential part of the network of highways and bridges, and the word is on record from the fourteenth century at least, sometimes as an element in minor place-names: 1387-8 <i>Causebrigengh</i>, Thimbleby (YRS50/185); 1467 <i>le Causey</i>, Barnsley (PNWR1/305); 1475 <i>the fotmans cawse be for William Chawe dore is defectyffe</i>, Selby (SS85/27). Money was frequently left in wills towards their maintenance: 1500 <i>I gyffe towards the mending of the causey of Ferrybrig a met of wheit</i>, Sherburn (Th33/35); 1515 <i>and to Long Calsey mendyng vjs viijd</i>, Ripon (SS74/331); 1531 <i>I gyff ... to the mendyng of the Caussay in the layn that goith to Fethirstone More vs</i> (Th26/325). In the context of river crossings the causey might mean stepping stones (OED) but in Yorkshire it was more often the raised approaches to a bridge. In 1532 Agnes Hemsworth made a bequest of 20s <i>unto the causye at </i>[the]<i> est end of Swyllyngton bryge </i>(Th11/50) and Camden used the word in this context. Later, a causey would be deemed to be part of the bridge when responsibility for its maintenance was in question. In fact, many bridges had causeys at both ends and their dimensions can be surprising. In 1682, the men working on Cottingley Bridge were to <i>repaire and make good all that cawsey at both ends of the Bridge near unto an hundred yards as farr as the same is now Layd, and raise the same sufficientlie with good Gravel stones, sand, etc </i>(QS1). At Eastburn, where the valley was quite wide and flat, the causeys were also of great length, with the result that the bridge <i>was commonly called Eastburn Causey </i>(QS1/46/4). The surveyors in 1687-8 were very explicit and they recommended causeys at each end: </br><i>one cawsey att the westend … to extend 100 yards in length from the foot of the Bridge, to bee 1 yard and a half broad and a yard and a half high, one end with the other, with twoe sluces for the passage of the water to bee each 4 foot wide, the cawsey to be made with hewn stone on each side … with filling and paveing.</i></br>Eastburn Bridge has been rebuilt since then but the sluices survive and preserve the former lines of the causeys. Away from the rivers there were rights of way which passed over marshy ground and they were paved with causey stones, sometimes especially for horse traffic, as in Sand Gate in Allerton near Bradford. It was being repaired in 1744 and the report stated that it consisted of <i>a High Horse Causeway and a Low Way. </i>It was judged that<i> The expense ... of paving the whole Breadth of the way </i>would be too great (QS1/83/2). Urban paving could also be referred as a causey: 1665 <i>Wee present ... these persons underwritten for nott repaireing the Causy before their dores</i>, Kirkgate, Wakefield (WCR5/114). It was used occasionally as a verb: 1672 <i>in Cawseying and repaireing of the said ways</i>, Rothwell (QS1/12/6). The modern spelling ‘causeway’ no doubt developed via the association with ‘highway’: 1572 <i>I gyve to the making and reparring of the causeway which ledeth from my house to the churches xs</i>, Thornton le Street (SS2/369); 1687 <i>leading </i>... <i>cause waie stones out of the highwaie</i>, Flockton (WCR13/125); 1744 <i>part of the said highway ... is a horse causeway,</i> Allerton (QS1/83/a).

ceil,,,,,,,," This word passed into English via Old French but it has a complicated etymology and three quite distinct Latin words have been suggested as the source. The OED discussion of the difficulties ends by saying that we cannot separate the English words from ‘ciel’, the French for canopy, and that will resonate with those who consider the implications of the word ‘ceiling’. By the fifteenth century, the verb meant to line the walls or roof of a room with boards or panelling, and it was used in 1469 when <i>five waynscots</i> were purchased for <i>seillyng</i> the Council Chamber in York (SS192/130). Also in York, in 1505, is a reference to <i>syllyng the chapel in the Bedderne</i> (SS45/281). These were institutional buildings but the word was certainly in more general use by the sixteenth century when gentlemen and yeomen were panelling their rooms in an attempt to impress visitors and improve their own comfort. In 1569, John Kaye of Woodsome wrote in his account book <i>I selyd my parlar and hall</i> (KayeCP). By that time though the roof and even outbuildings could also be ceiled and a description of Esholt Priory at the time of the Dissolution includes mention of a roof <i>seylid with waynscottes</i> and a <i>cowe house … seyled abowght</i> (YAJ9/322). The word is recorded with something of its more recent associations in 1755, when a room in Castle Hall, Mirfield was said to be <i>ceiled over the top with ancient Plaister work</i> (D/I/192). There appears to be an extension of the word’s meaning to ‘panelled’ from the sixteenth century at least, with examples recorded in wills and inventories. The earliest reference is to <i>one seled chiste</i> in Emley, in 1571 (FACccxxi) but later I have noted beds and chairs so described. There was <i>one seeled long setle</i> in the inventory of Thomas Foster of Slaidburn in 1692 (CS1/65).",,SS192/130,,1469,York,SS45/281,,1505,York,KayeCP,,1569,Woodsome,D/1/192,,1755,"Castle Hall, Mirfield",FACccxxi,,1571,Emley,CS1/65,,1692,Slaidburn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ceiling board,sealing board,seale spars,,,,,," The wood which was used for panelling was referred to from the fifteenth century as ‘wainscots’ and then more frequently as ‘ceiling boards’. The <i>celing burdes</i> or <i>sealing burdes</i> that Robert Hirst of Leeds described in 1499 as <i>now lieng in my laith</i> [barn] were intended for church repairs (SS53/161). Another early reference is in Ripon: in <i>c</i>.1520, John Henryson was paid <i>for making scaffaldes et sawyng seylyng bordes</i> (SS81/202). Finally, in <i>all the ceileing and partitions</i> of a house in Lythe, in 1734, the inference is that ‘ceiling’ could be used on its own to mean the panelling. In 1653, a labourer in the North Riding village of Wass was accused of stealing <i>fifteen seale-sparres</i>: they were defined by Canon Atkinson as the battens to which the ceiling boards would be attached (NRQS5/131).",sylinge bourds; seal ,SS53/161,,1499,Leeds,SS81/202,,c.1520,Ripon,NRQS5/131,,1653,Wass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One later Yorkshire example, in a will of 1546, is worth quoting just to put the word in context and demonstrate a typical spelling: <i>I give to my frende Mathue Tompson … a carved bedde steide … togeders with the fether bed, one bolster, too pillows, a cownterpoynte of Tappesserie warke of Imagerie, with the Celor and teaster and valaunces …</i> (Th19/179).

centre,,,,,,,,"The OED has examples of this word from 1611 but it actually has a much longer and more complicated history than that. The ‘centres’, for it was often used in the plural, were the timber framework which supported a stone arch until all the keystones were safely in place: 1675 <i>wood for centres,</i> Ilkley Bridge (QS1). It was not a term confined to bridge-building nor even to arches, and was used more generally for substantial roof timbers in barns and houses. When Beverley Bar was being constructed, in 1409, the accounts included a charge of 6d <i>pro cariagio de syntyrs</i>, and later, in the same document, two carpenters were paid for making <i>fenestras et syntyrs</i>: these must have been ‘centres’ although they were not necessarily supporting an arch (ERAS4/31). In 1703, the disbursements for Pickering tithe barn included <i>one paire of senters</i> valued at 15s (YAJ35/221) and a more explicit reference in 1754, in Hutton-le-Hole, was to <i>2 pair of centres or Furks standing towards the East end of the barn</i> (MD437). These pairs of ‘centres’ may have been crucks that supported the ridge timbers. An early use of the word in connection with bridges is in the Lady’s Bridge agreement: 1485-6 <i>the making of centres shall be of both theyr costys</i>, Sheffield (HS1/59), and an unusual spelling occurs in the Catterick Bridge contract: 1422 <i>the landstathes and the seentrees (NRQS3/35). Such spellings are an indication that some clerks believed that ‘tree’ was actually part of the word and they almost certainly explain the previously obscure term ‘signtree’, which is commonly found in other building records in Lancashire and Yorkshire. This is dealt with separately under ‘seentree’.

chain,,,,,,,,"‘Chain’ is not a word that will be misunderstood but chains were items employed in a number of interesting ways that deserve comment. For example, if tolls could be charged for the use of a bridge, it was not unusual to place chains across the points of access: Leland visited Richmond <i>c.</i>1540 and noted the bridge over the Swale <i>wich is sometime chaynid</i> (YAJ38/311). In 1650, £3 6s 8d was paid at Ayton in the North Riding <i>for a new chaine for a bridge</i> (NRQS5/54) and in 1610 there is reference to <i>the cheyninge</i> of the bridge at Skipton on Swale (NRQS3/49). Chains were also placed across turnpike roads if it was felt that some travellers were avoiding the toll bars, and this use gave rise to minor place-names such as Chain Bar or Road near Marsden. In 1807 it was <i>Ordered that a Chain be fixed across the road near Oaks</i> [Lindley] and that some person be appointed <i>to take the whole Toll</i> there, <i>the same as is taken at Outlane</i> (RT41/26). They were in everyday use in certain industries, especially coal-mining, and in 1734 the blacksmith at Colsterdale made 11 new chains <i>for the lads to draw corves with </i>(BM82/85).",clatch; gin; tools and implements; wath,YAJ38/311,,c.1540,Richmond,NRQS5/54,,1650,Ayton,NRQS3/49,,1610,Skipton on Swale,RT41/26,,1807,[Lindley],BM82/85,,1734,Colsterdale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

chimney,chimneth,kymnay,chimley,,,,," The various related meanings of chimney reflect the word’s semantic history. From the seventeenth century it has been used to describe the flue that carries smoke from the fire up into the open air, especially that part which projects above the roof - the chimney-pot that is. That development may have started in the seventeenth century: 1682 <i>in the angle of the said chamber he shall erect one little chimney for the conveniency of the said roome, and shall carry the shaft ... soe high as may be convenient for the avoydyng of smoake,</i> Scriven (YAJ16/112). However, the chimneys referred to in early documents were usually iron grates, used to hold a fire, possibly something like braziers. They were moveable objects and could therefore be bought and sold, passed from father to son, or even stolen. In 1317, for example, Henry Dernelove was said to have stolen an iron chimney from the chaplain of Batley, valued at 10 pence (YRS78/187). </br>In the sense of fireplace or grate the English word has been noted in literary works from roughly the same period (OED), and it occurs frequently in inventories and wills from the later 1300s. In 1377 an inventory of chattels in Sewerby listed two <i>kymnays </i>(YRS76/129) and in 1423 Henry Bowet, the archbishop of York possessed <i>j chamino de ferro pro carbon </i>(SS45/69). Elizabeth Nettylton of Roundhay bequeathed <i>an yerne chymney</i> to Jane Nettilton, probably her niece, in 1519 (Th9/89). Such chimneys seem to have remained in use well into Elizabeth’s reign, for Lord Wharton possessed <i>two great Irone Chymneys </i>in 1568, one in the hall and the other in the kitchen. They were described as <i>heyrelomes</i> in an inventory of his possessions and may already have been somewhat old-fashioned (YRS134/32). </br>Many sixteenth-century references appear to use the word in reference to a more permanent structure, around or over the iron grate. In Eshton, for example, in 1538, two <i>fayre</i> chimneys are listed, one of stone and one of wood and mortar (YAJ9/324). And it was also in this period that the flue itself came to be known as the chimney, almost certainly via the compound ‘chimney-pipe’. When Sir John Kaye carried out major improvements to his house at Woodsome in 1573, <i>he buyldid … the kytchyn chymne and the upper parlar chymnye pypis of stone</i> (KayeCP). Leland had already called these pipes ‘tunnells’, marvelling at how the smoke 'by this meanes … [is] wonder strangly convayed' (1538). The terms ‘chimney-pipes’ and ‘pipe-stones’ feature in several northern building records from that period: 1598 <i>Henrie Beaumont is to have for the cutting of pipe stonis for two chimneys, eyght pence the day</i>, Whitley (WBE/1/130). </br>Nevertheless, many chimneys or flues continued to be of wood or to have wooden parts, well into the early 1700s at least - even at Woodsome. In 1696, Dr Kaye noted that <i>the wooden pipe</i> of his chamber chimney had caught fire and been destroyed (KayeD). In 1678, the diarist Ralph Thoresby had workmen pull down the chimneys in his house, in order to <i>build them more safely, conveniently and of brick</i>.",chimneth; kymnay,YAJ16/112,,1682,Scriven,YRS78/187,,1317,Batley,YRS76/129,,1377,Sewerby,SS45/69,,1423,York,Th9/89,,1519,Roundhay,YRS134/32,,1568,np,YAJ9/324,,1538,Eshton,KayeCP,,1573,Woodsome,WBE/1/130,,1598,Whitley,KayeD,,1696,Woodsome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clabbord,clapboard,clapholt,,,,, These words may have the same meaning: initially they referred to split oak boards which were imported from the Baltic and used by coopers for barrel-staves.," They were brought into east-coast ports such as Hull, and moved inland along the rivers. In Yorkshire, there were numerous ports on the Ouse and its tributaries, for example, Boroughbridge, Cawood, Selby and York. ‘Clapholt’ is the earlier term and has a German origin, so ‘clapboard’ may have developed in England as a semi translation, possibly influenced by the fact that ‘clapboard’ was increasingly used for panelling. Early evidence includes: 1453 <i>3C waynescotes 1 M 2C clapholt; </i>1471-2 <i>12C clapholttes</i>, Hull (YRS144/4,161); 1526 <i>pro iij.c tabulis vocatis clapburdes 14s 8d</i>, York (SS35/100). Extracts from the accounts of the wood carvers who were working on the high altar at Ripon point to other uses for ‘clapboard’: <i>c.</i>1520 <i>dicto servienti for carreyng of ij C. clapbordes de Ebor. ad Burghtbryg 8d </i>(SS81/200);<i> Item de craneagh de waynescot ad Hull 12d. Item pro craneagh de clapbordes ibidem 4d</i> (YAJ29/176). In this case a Hull beer-brewer was the middleman. In New England, ‘clapboarding’ refers to the thin boards used for the outer covering of timber houses: it was a practice in some English counties and it seems likely that emigrants took that meaning of the word to America.

clatch,clatch-iron,,,,,,," No reference to the word ‘clatch’ has been found in glossaries or major reference works but it was clearly a device on which the colliers sat as the ‘gin’ took them up and down the pit shaft. The word can be found in printed sources, notably in the report into child labour in the coal mines: 1842 <i>Ann Ambler … comes up the pit cross-lapped with us in the clatch harness</i>: Will Dyson and Ann Ambler were <i>drawn up cross-lapped upon the clatch-iron,</i> Elland (ERP172). These statements were accompanied by a sketch which confirms that the clatch was simply a metal bar and the records suggest that it had changed little over several centuries: 1666 <i>three Roopes two paire of clach Irons, thre crockes</i>, South Crosland (WBD/2/81); 1729 <i>a pair of Clatch Irons and 1 Iron chain</i>, Stainland (QS1/68/4). The purpose of the chains which hung from each end of the bar, clearly visible in the sketch, is not immediately obvious, but only part of them can be seen. It may be that they were intended as a kind of safety-belt but were being ignored: alternatively perhaps they served in some way to balance the contraption. </br>Simple as it was the clatch represented an improvement on earlier methods for which there is first-hand evidence. A descent into a Derbyshire lead-mine in 1631 is described as follows: ‘I was let down not in the basket but by a strong stick laid across the hook of the rope. I sat on it between my legs, one hand holding the rope the other guiding me from grating on the sides’ (HS5). An account of an accident in Northowram in 1673 tells how a miner was let <i>down in a scoop or basket, there being a peece of wood at the other end of the rope to poyse it</i>, that is to stabilise the basket (OH1/351-2). Such practices were inherently unsafe: in 1694, for example, two colliers were killed as they descended the shaft at Stretton in Derbyshire ‘when they fell off pick shafts inserted in the haulage ropes’ (SYC7). </br>The clatch-iron is likely to have a longer history than these references indicate but as yet nothing has come to light about its use before 1666 and the etymology remains uncertain.",,ERP172,,1842,Elland,WBD/2/81,,1666,South Crosland,QS1/68/4,,1729,Stainland,HS5,,1631,Derbyshire,OH1/351-2,,1673,Northowram,SYC7,,1694,Stretton in Derbyshire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

clog,,,,,,,," We are likely to be most familiar with this word in the sense of ‘wooden shoe’, that is the traditional north-country clog which was strengthened with iron or brass at the heels and edges, and had irons on the thick wooden sole. However, the evidence for this usage is comparatively late and may date with certainty only from the seventeenth century: 1692 <i>gave William Goodall </i>[a coal miner]<i> to pay for his cloges 6d</i> (MS11); 1696-7 <i>For ... yroning his Cloggs</i>, Conistone (RW31); 1723 <i>a pair of clogs</i>, Whitley (WBE/34); 1755 <i>one pair of Leather Clogs</i>, East Ardsley (QS1). In an inventory submitted to the magistrates in 1731, Timothy Eyre of Austerfield listed<i> a paire of leather cloages</i> among the possessions he had lost in a disastrous fire (QS1/70/7). It is true that clogs are referred to from the late fourteenth century: 1390 <i>patens et clogges</i>, York (SS35/243) but the connection with pattens means that these are likely to have been wooden-soled overshoes, of the type worn by women to protect their feet from wet or dirt. Both Walpole and Jane Austen mention women’s clogs in this sense as late as the eighteenth century. </br>It was no doubt the wooden sole of the clog that was responsible for its name. Much earlier, certainly from the fourteenth century, the more general use of the word was to any substantial and roughly shaped piece of wood, as in 'a Clog of an Oke' employed <i>c.</i>1400 as a weapon (OED). <i>One chopin clogg</i> in a Pudsey inventory in 1633 was probably used for chopping firewood (LRS2/89), and <i>a clogg</i> in Huddersfield market place in 1716 was a butcher’s stall (QS1). Similar clogs of wood are mentioned frequently. The fabric rolls for York Minster in 1418 list <i>ix magnis clogges </i>(SS35/38), and in 1553 a Birstall dyer left all the timber at his door and <i>three clogges in the Workhouse Croft </i>to his son (Th19/340). The Yule clog was the heavy piece of wood burnt on the fire at Christmas, in Scotland in particular: the similarity between this term and Yule log is of interest, for both clog and log are of uncertain etymology and it is tempting to think that they may share a common history.</br>In a less-usual context Bradford tenants were ordered in 1663 to <i>scour the ditches … from the Clogg of Wood wherein the wimble hole is </i>(BAS5/291): a wimble was a boring tool, probably an auger. It is possible therefore that this prominent piece of timber had served an earlier purpose, for clogs of wood were sometimes attached to grazing animals, in order to impede their movement and prevent them from straying. They were even attached to human beings, by a cord or chain I imagine, so clogs of this kind would have needed a hole bored through them. Smaller bits of wood could be used more positively, tied to an object so that it could not be lost. In 1562, it was said that 'Euery key hath a clog', a practice that has not died out (OED).</br>Examples of clog as a verb are not uncommon. In 1694, a workman called William Priestley was paid 4d for <i>clogging the bells</i> of Almondbury church (D12/18). I am uncertain what the precise meaning of this phrase was, but presumably it involved holding or restraining the movement of the bells with large pieces of wood. To ‘clog up’ the works would eventually be a widely-used phrase. In the sense of ‘encumbrance’ the word also had figurative uses, most comically in 1577, when a wife was described as 'a grieuous clog to her husband' (OED). </br>An enigmatic entry in Haworth parish register in 1733 gives a list of <i>marriages at Bradford and by clog and shoe in Lancashire</i> (Corr.). Although this could be interpreted as some unusual local custom it may simply mean that the married couple had walked over into Lancashire to be married. Haworth was, after all, right on the county boundary.

clout,,,,,,," A word of Old English origin, on record from <i>a</i>.700.

More unusual is a reference to a brass plate with which a tinker had mended a pot: 1520 <i>To Agnes Sherp a brasse pott with a tincler clowte</i>, Ripon (SS79/187). It was used occasionally in metal-working contexts as a verb: 1835 <i>2 men 1 Day hooping and clouting</i>, Wath (GRD).</br>It was also the usual word for the small leather patches used by cobblers and is mentioned in the cordwainers’ ordinances: 1417 <i>aut novos talos fecerit</i> (<i>Anglice dictum cloutys or talons)</i>, York (SS120/189) and in shoemakers’ wills: 1546 <i>I bequeath to Richarde my sone ij dacre of leder clowtes</i>, Spofforth (Th19/164). In this connection ‘clout leather’ was an attributive use: 1494 <i>1d to towll </i>[toll]<i> for selling off clouteledyr on the same feyre daye, </i>Nafferton (YRS51/38); 1599 <i>No tanner dwelling without the liberties of the town shall sell any clout lether or upper lether in any place within the liberties but only in open market</i>, Beverley (YRS84/76).

One early by-name probably referred to a cobbler: 1307 <i>Adam Clouter</i>, Wakefield (YRS36/77).</br>A clout might also be a piece of cloth, especially one in which pins or needles were secured: 1461 <i>4 cloutes nedells</i>, Hull (YRS144/36); <i>c</i>.1504 <i>ij clowtes of pynns</i>, York (SS53/192). More pejoratively it was a rag: 1564 <i>hayth called prest capps and surpluses vile clowtes and rages</i>, Hessle (PTD212).

coal,,,,,,,," The word is of Old English origin and it occurs in documents from the early ninth century (OED). It has diverse but related meanings and from <i>c.</i>1200 is on record as the name for the fuel that is produced when wood has been burnt, that is charcoal: from roughly the same period it was the word also for the ‘stone’ that miners extracted from the ground, commonly used as domestic fuel and by smiths and lime-burners. In many accounts the plural ‘coals’ was used in both cases. In that early, overlapping period the latter was commonly called sea-coal, albeit often in Latin: 1292 <i>In carbonibus marinis emptis xls iiijd</i>, Bolton Priory (YRS154/44); 1304 <i>minere carbonum marinarum</i>, Masham (YRS37/58); 1371 <i>ij schaldres de secole</i>, York (SS35/9). Later, where ambiguity might arise, the context often holds the key to our understanding: 1457 <i>it shall be lefull … to gete and have fuell … for the fyre as of stone or cole,</i> West Bretton (YRS102/25); 1638 <i>pay the several wages to them due for … leadeing of charcoale … and restore to the poore menn their Tallyes of the coales ledd</i>, West Riding (YAJ5/372). The verb ‘to coal’ usually meant ‘convert into charcoal’: 1457 <i>the woddes of the seid mese shall be coled</i>, West Bretton (YRS102/24); 1466 <i>the said woods to cut downe, coale and springe</i>, Denby Dale (YDK72). Sometimes, though, it meant to extract coal from the ground, perhaps illegally: 1709 <i>believing him to have a hand in their coaling my ground</i>, Whitley (WBC).

coal-bed,,,,,,, The bed of coal was a layer or stratum of coal and the term is much older than has been implied.," The first OED reference is 1802 and it might be thought that ‘bed’ in this sense was a meaning coined by geologists. It actually has a long history in mining contexts, and two Hipperholme documents point to its use in the Elizabethan period. It occurred in 1581 (HTu157) and again in 1591 <i>one myne of coals within the greaveship of Hipperholme, with all rights and the several colebeddes to the same mine apertainyng, lying and being</i>, Northowram (HAS31/74). In 1665 coal mines in Crigglestone had several <i>coalebedds thereto belonging</i> (WCR5/97). It is clear that from a very early date the boring methods used by colliers made them aware of the existence of beds of coal at different levels and of different quality, and in each region these were given distinctive names, e.g. 1694 <i>paid for getting on the Low Bed; paid for getting on the Crow Bed</i>, Farnley (MS11); 1713 <i>towards the Soft Bed coals on the rise side</i>, Shibden (HAS30/143). This is another term which provides evidence of the miners’ geological awareness.

coal carrier,,,,,,,," When Thomas Drake of Shelf died in 1601 he was described as <i>cole carrier</i> (YRS24/53) and since there were coal-pits in the township he seems likely to have earned his living by carrying coals to customers, probably on the back of a pony.

coal-man,,,,,,," A word used for a man who had to do with coal, possibly as a landowner."," In 1659 Mr Richard Horsfall, <i>coal man</i>, enjoyed the status of ‘gentleman’ and lived at Storthes Hall in Thurstonland. He was indicted at the manor court ‘for not filling in his coal pits’ (WCR18/141). ",coal-miner,WCR18/141,,1659,Thurstonland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
coal-mine,,,,,,, The OED has examples from 1613 and gives it the same meaning as coal-pit and colliery.," One of the earliest Yorkshire references is to a coal-mine near Rotherham: 1369-70 ‘all the coal-mine (<i>myne de carbonus</i>)<i> … </i>in Cortworth’ (TWH28/203); 1486 <i>with due clensyng of the seid myne</i>, Cortworth (YAJ12/236). Coal-mines are referred to frequently from the 1500s: 1538 <i>the kings rent for the cole myne of Broume More</i>, Manston (YRS50/111); 1541 <i>the occupation of the coal myne</i>, Horton (LRS2/6); 1548 <i>my coyle myne in Beiston</i> (Th19/235); 1567 <i>one colemyne in the tenure of Robert Beverleye</i>, North Bierley (LRS2/130). At this period in its history the ‘mine’ may more often have been a reference to the underground coal reserves in a certain territory, rather than to an individual pit. Mr Beaumont of Whitley listed <i>a coale myne</i> among his assets in 1543 at a time when coal was being extracted in more than one place on his estate (YRS2/106). It became a relatively common alternative to coal-pit from the sixteenth century, possibly because it avoided ambiguity with ‘coal’ meaning charcoal, and a Bradford lease has: 1659 <i>those pitts or mynes of Coales, </i>North Bierley (MM/A/255). Even as late as 1702, though, lessees in Shelf were expected to <i>Leave two pitts belonging the said Coalemyne … open and fit to be entered into</i> (DBB1/2/30).

coal-miner,,,,,,,," A relatively uncommon term before the modern period. In 1686 Richard Williamson of Huddersfield was described in his will as <i>coalemyner </i>(YRS89/164) but he was actually a prosperous businessman, the first farmer of the town’s market tolls. ‘Coal-miner’ was not an occupational term in this case but an indication that he was in possession of a coal-mine: indeed he left coal-pits to one of his sons when he died. The word may already have come into use more generally as a synonym for ‘collier’: 1699 <i>Joseph Woodheade of Shelffe, coalminer</i> (LRS2/122).

coal-mining tools and implements,,,,,,,," Colliers did not own the tools they used: they might belong to the person who was operating the pit or to the land-owner, and they had to be handed over at the end of a term. In the lease of an ironstone pit in 1576 it was<i> agreed that the said Sir Thomas Danby shall lende unto the said persons and theyre partners 2 ropes, 4 iron wedges and one Iron Hammer to work in the said eye. John and his partners stand charged to deliver the same again eyther whole or broken … at theyre works ending or giving up</i>, Farnley (BM82/16). Such tools were marked with letters which identified the owner, and in a dispute between William Woodhead and Richard Sterne in 1713 it was mentioned that the picks were all stamped with the letter ‘L’: the landowner was Mr Samuel Lister of Shibden Hall (HAS30/141). Similarly, in 1815 a coal-owner named Michael Stocks was on trial and one collier testified to finding a pick marked M S in the hollow work of Cold Harbour pit (HAS31/99).

coal-pit,,,,,,,," The term ‘coal-pit’ poses problems similar to those of ‘coal’ and ‘collier’ for it could refer in the past to places where charcoal was burned.

cockaygne,,,,,,, A word found in Middle English which referred to ‘an imaginary country of luxury and idleness’ (OED).," It occurs as a place-name and surname in many parts of England and examples are found over a wide area from the twelfth century, before its first recorded use in literature. Although it has parallels in other European languages the etymology remains obscure but a comparison can be made between the localities of Cockan in Clayton near Bradford and Cocken in the Lancashire parish of Dalton. Ekwall’s comment on this name is that it was probably ‘jocular’ since it referred to land that had been cleared by the monks of Furness Abbey, back-breaking toil at the best. That may apply also to the Clayton name since there is mention in an undated thirteenth-century charter of ‘12 bovates of land in a new assart of Cockan<i> de nova captura’; </i>that is a piece of land newly won from the waste (BAS8/292).

cocklake,,,,,,,," This fascinating word incorporates Old Norse <i>leikr</i> meaning ‘play, sport’ and as a minor place-name it has been noted at least a dozen times in Yorkshire, e.g. 1605 <i>at Whiteyside, at a place called Cocklakes</i>, Grinton (NRQS1/14). Unfortunately many of the examples are quite late and their identification is not always straightforward. The earliest on record is <i>le Cokelayke</i> in Hartlington (1305) which survives as Cocklake Ridge, whereas <i>Cockleyckebanke</i> in Rathmell (1618) is now Cockley Bank (MD217). Some ‘Cockleys’ clearly belong here and I have no doubt that the full corpus of names should include many localities in the northern counties which now have the spellings Cocklaw, Cocklet(h), Cocklick(s) and Cocklock.</br>The history of a Slaidburn place-name provides evidence of such variations, illustrating the problem that scribes were having with the suffix by the seventeenth century. The locality is likely to be the <i>Cocklaik </i>where James Robinson was living in 1601 (YRS3/199) but later forms include: 1625 <i>Cockland</i>; 1639 <i>Cocklick</i> (CS2-4) and 1713 <i>Cocklicks</i> (PR). These suggest that the meaning was no longer transparent to clerks, who were perhaps not local men, but neither can we be certain that ‘cocklake’ had survived in everyday vocabulary. Wright listed it as a West Riding word (EDD) and quoted a reference by Lucas in Studies in Nidderdale (1882), but reference to the text shows that the author was speculating about the meaning of a local place-name.</br>Nor can we be certain when the word came into use but it certainly has a very long history and there are much earlier examples elsewhere in the north-west of the country: <i>c</i>.1240 <i>Cokelaikemoore </i>in Westmorland (PNWe162) and 1189 <i>Cockelayc</i> in Cumberland, a ‘lost’ locality (PNCu290). It is quite possible therefore that its history goes back to the years before the Norman Conquest.</br>The literal meaning of the two elements is ‘cock – play’ and several interpretations of that have been offered by editors of place-name works, including ‘place frequented by grouse’ and ‘place where woodcock play’: Diana Whaley goes a little further, saying ‘the place where blackcocks play’ but the explanation which comes closest to the meaning, at least in my view, is that of Bruce Dickins who treated <i>cokelayk</i> as a single item and quoted Lady Henley’s suggestion that it is a term for the display site of the black grouse or blackcock (PNCu466). The dialect word <i>lek</i> is still used for these ‘arenas’ which are situated in open locations with short vegetation. The birds return year after year to the same patch of ground and it is easy to see how the word became a place-name. </br>Indeed it is a prolific minor name, with almost thirty examples already noted in the three counties of Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire, all in the north-west of the country. Other sites may have less specific names, such as <i>lekestaynes</i> recorded in Thorpe near Linton in 1471 (PNWR6/97). The term might be of special interest to ornithologists, since the black grouse has declined in recent years and a distribution map of Cocklake would provide information about the bird’s former range.",,NRQS1/14,,1605,Grinton,MD217,,1305,Hartlington,MD217,,1618,Rathmell,YRS3/199,,1601,Slaidburn,PNWe162,,c.1240,Westmorland,PNCu290,,1189,Cumberland,PNWR6/97,,1471,Thorpe near Linton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reaney quotes examples of Cockshoot as a by-name from the late thirteenth century and it was well established in Sussex in the poll tax of 1379. McKinley noted its frequency in east Lancashire from the fourteenth century but disputed the traditional explanation of its meaning, saying that it referred in that region to a particular type of agricultural land (ESS4/201).

These are ambiguous and probably referred to charcoal-burners not coal-miners: the Roman tilery in Grimescar Wood in Fixby was discovered in 1590 by <i>Colyers … framynge a pitt to burn charcoales </i>(OWR3/1/6) and the <i>Colyers dwellinge in Ampleford </i>in 1586 were also burning charcoal: they <i>had a close called Collyer Carr in ther possession</i> (YRS114/148). In the following example the colliers were certainly coal-miners: 1541 <i>the occupation of the colle myne … by the collyers</i>, Horton (LRS2/6). The term ‘wood collier’ had come into use by the sixteenth century, a possible result of the growing importance of coal-mining, and it made the distinction clear: 1577 <i>Edward Hirste of Smithie Place, wood collier,</i> Honley (WBD/6/11). In the Sheffield register this word can be contrasted with ground collier, presumably for a miner working underground: 1711 <i>John Green, Ground-Collier</i>; 1720 <i>Robert Moorhouse, wood collier</i> (PR). The OED has ‘charcoal colliers’ in Althorp in 1636 but the first recorded use there of ‘charcoal-burner’ is in a travel book written by William Spalding in 1841, since which time it has been widely employed by other writers. It occurs much earlier in the North Riding: 1615 <i>Lambert Belfeild of Kyrby Mooresyd charcoal burner</i>, Brandsby (NYRO44/96).</br>The context usually makes the occupation of the 'collier' clear. The following extract refers to charcoal burnt in the Esholt ironworks: 1568 <i>The dusson ys 12 seme or 12 quarter alle one mesuer so that 3 colyeres wyll burne 12 score dousson colle in the yere</i>, Esholt (BAS10/247).",coal-miner,YRS62/61,,1225,Goodmanham,YRS29/262,,1297,Hipperholme,YRS78/186,,1317,Sandal,PTWR,,1379,Thorpe Salvin,OWR3/1/6,,1590,Fixby,YRS114/148,,1586,Ampleforth,LRS1/6,,1541,Horton,WBD/6/11,,1577,Honley,PR,,1711,Sheffield,PR,,1720,Sheffield,NYRO44/96,,1615,Brandsby,BAS10/247,,1568,Esholt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

collier housing,,,,,,, This term is on record from the early eighteenth century.," 1704 <i>Occupiers of collyer housing, 9s 9d</i>, Bradford (BAS1/53): it resulted directly from the Act of 1589 which sought to control the erection of new dwellings in areas of common or waste, by demanding that four acres at least be assigned to any new cottage. There were exceptions, notably in the case of ‘workmen or labourers in … coal mines’ and that allowed coal owners to attract colliers by providing houses for them (SAL6/409-11). It meant that certain types of house came to be associated with mining communities and occasionally that created local tensions. At the Quarter Sessions in 1649, Mr Thomas Stringer was accused of increasing the number of poor families in Crofton by <i>erecting of divers cottages … for the habitacon of his colliers and workemen, </i>a wording which directly reflects that in the Act (QS10/2/273). Lucy Caffyn identified single-storey cottages in the neighbourhood of Bradford and Huddersfield as ‘the principal type of accommodation’ for colliers from the late eighteenth century, so-called low-deckers (LC28). She stated that when John Elwell and John Crawshaw leased the mineral rights at Shelf in 1793, they received permission to build … <i>habitations for workers</i> on the common land of the manor (LC32).",Beeston Pithill; low decker,BAS1/53,,1704,Bradford,QS10/2/273,,1649,Crofton,LC32,,1793,Shelf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the earliest period ‘colliery’ was a collective noun, referring not to a single coal-pit but to the coal reserves in a particular territory; it might therefore consist of several coal-pits at any one time: 1683 <i>made 30 li or 40 li per annum or thereabouts cleare out of … the severall Coalpitts or Collyery</i>, Whitkirk (YAJ36/330).

It is possible therefore that ‘colster’ is the so-called feminine form of ‘coler’, that is one employed in working coal.

coltrough,coultrough,,,,,," The OED has ‘cool-trough’, first recorded in 1777 in a context where the meaning is clearly the same as that of the ‘coultrough’ used in the Sheffield smithies."," The prefix is taken by the editors at face value and the word is explained as a ‘trough in which anything is cooled’. The Yorkshire evidence is much earlier: in his will of 1510, transcribed in the Ecclesfield parish register, Thomas Parker of Whitley left his <i>water wheel at Whitley</i> and <i>two stone troughes called Coltroughes</i> to his son John: in 1542 Richard Boyer of Sheffield bequeathed to his son and John Hobson all his <i>smythe gere and the coltroughe</i> (TWH13/71). There are many additional references in the inventories of cutlers from the seventeenth century: in 1689 Francis Brownell, scissorsmith, had a <i>Stithie and Stock and 2 Coultroughs</i> and in 1709 Joseph Webster had <i>A Stiddy and Stock Cow trough and glaszer </i>(IH). Some of these spellings raise a doubt about the usual interpretation and the explanation of the prefix may need to be revised. One possible connection is ‘cowl’ in the sense of a tub or vessel for water (OED), in which case the source is likely to be the Middle English <i>cuvele</i>.

In his will this William Routh left a stithy, a sleck-trough and a fore-hammer to his brother John. There were also combsmiths in Richmond from the late 1390s and it seems likely that these urban smiths were producing iron combs for the woollen trade. The occupation’s apparent decline there may reflect the industry’s changing fortunes. In fact, occasional examples are found later in the textile towns: 1659 <i>William Hobson of Kirkheaton, Combsmith</i> (Th14/289) and it occurred also as a surname in the Wakefield area from the late fifteenth century (GRDict).

corf,,,,,,,," Some of the earliest examples of this word are in Scottish sources but it has not been noted anywhere in the British Isles before the second half of the fifteenth century. At that time the ‘corf’ was a basket, which links it etymologically to ‘Korb’, the modern German word for basket, and this adds credibility to the argument that it was a late borrowing from one of the Low German languages.</br>The OED first notes the use of ‘corf’ in connection with mining in 1653, at which time it may still be described as a basket. It was strong enough to hold substantial amounts of coal and also to withstand the rough treatment it received as it was moved about underground and taken up and down the pit shaft. The most explicit information about how the earliest baskets were made and used is in <i>The Compleat Collier</i> (1708): the ‘corver’ made them of hazel rods, with saplings of oak, ash or alder for what the narrator called the ‘corf-bow’, probably a handle. They needed to be sturdy since the corves were ‘subject to Clash and beat against the Shaft sides’. Their function is described thus: ‘Labourers which are called Barrow-men … take the hewed Coals from the Hewers … and filling the Corves with these Wrought Coals put or pull away the full Curves [sic] … upon a Sledge of Wood and so halled all along the Barrow-way to the Pit Shaft … where they hook it by the Corf-Bow to the Cable, which … is drawn up to the top’ (CC27-8). </br>An isolated reference in Brandsby in the North Riding takes the link with mining in Yorkshire back much further but raises questions about what the corves were made of there. In Mr Cholmeley’s <i>Coeles charges</i> in June 1616 the items included picks, shovel irons, <i>the collyer waige viijs</i>, and <i>2 corves, 4 stapples to them viijd</i> (NYRO44/119). It is likely that these ‘staples’ were U-shaped metal handles which may imply that the corves were made of wood. In Farnley, in 1707, the accounts listed expenses <i>for new Corves and of one mending, for the wright worke 6s 4d, nailes 4d</i> (MS11). A Beeston reference in 1754 <i>to two corfes slipering 1s 8d, </i>points to the use of iron runners (DB129/4). It is known that corves were later made of wood and iron but perhaps the practice has a longer history in some regions. They were certainly in use long before 1787, the date when they are said to have been invented by a Sheffield ‘viewer’ called John Carr (SYC34). However, Carr’s contribution may have been that he fitted guides to prevent the corves from bumping against the sides of the shaft when being raised. By the early nineteenth century corves had axletrees, cods, corner plates and wheels (Mss4c/17): the cods were the axle bearings. </br>Corves are mentioned regularly in Yorkshire colliery accounts; in Farnley (1690), Swillington (1730) and Elsecar (1752) and it is clear that the loaded corf came increasingly to be seen as a standard measure: 1704 <i>A pit sunke about 20 yards from … Dick Taylor’s pit, it is 13 yards all but 6 inches deepe and Coales got in it from no 6th to no 13 is 124 Corves</i>, Farnley (MS11).

As a dwelling a cote was associated with small size and poverty: 1573 <i>a littil howse or coyte</i>, Bradford (BAS5/198); 1625 <i>one old house called a coite</i>, South Crosland (YDK89) and it gave rise to numerous minor place-names: 1595 <i>an olde house or cote called Howeroid coite</i>, Barkisland (HM/A/96). As a place where animals or materials might be kept its use dates from the fifteenth century (OED) and several examples have been noted in Yorkshire, e.g. 1687 <i>the Swine coat or hen house</i>, Conistone (RW31); 1739 <i>1 swine coat or hogsty</i>, Riddlesden (MD194).

cottage,cottage house,cottager,cottagry,,,," A cottage was formerly a small dwelling, typically associated with families or individuals of lowly status."," 1443 <i>a plase then being in the tenour of Margaret Judson, a cotag wyth a yard lygyng therby</i>, Stockeld (YRS76/149); 1491 <i>all the right and tytill of a meyss a coteghe and vi oxgang of land</i>, Glusburn (YRS69/70). The compound 'cottage-house' occurs in Yorkshire and was in regular use from the sixteenth century. I have found no reference elsewhere to the term and it may simply have been a regional verion of cottage. It was clearly the dwelling of somebody who was less well-off: 1574 <i>Item I give to everye cottage house within the town of Southcave one pecke of multer corne</i> (Kaner83); 1650 <i>one cottage house and garden in the lane</i>, Bowling (DD/SR/1/20/23); 1681 <i>all my right ... in the cottage house in Gowthropp, in Selby, & the close to the same belonging</i> (YRS47/154); 1722 <i>unto my wife the title and tenant right of one Cottage House in … the possession of Robert Askwith</i>, Nesfield (GRD). The Act of 1589 had given the word cottage new meaning, by insisting that newly-built cottages must henceforth possess four acres of land, enough for the tenants not to be a charge on the township. There were exceptions, notably for sailors, game-keepers, labourers in coal-mines, quarries and the like; that is workmen who were unlikely to be a problem for the overseers of the poor. There is an interesting definition of a cottage tenancy in a survey of one East Riding manor: 1600 <i>Cotages be those to which doth belonge neyther Lande in the common fields … nor common in the oxpasture yett haue they common of pasture in the cowpasture shepe pasture & Auerish fieldes how small soeuer ther rent be</i>, Settrington (YRS126/65). Further details follow but this hints at the different shades of meaning from one manor to another. Such holdings were distinct in Settrington from ‘husbandries’ and ‘grass farms’ and these terms also will have had very localised meanings. The tenants were referred to as cottagers: 1578 <i>Item I give to the cottigers of Southcave everye one of them iid</i> (Kaner96); 1600 <i>if the cottingers rent exceed 6s 8d then he is allowed common proportionable to the surplusage</i>, Settrington (YRS126/13). In 1697 Abraham de la Pryme used the words <i>cottagry and half cottagry</i> when he referred to customary practices in the manor of Broughton near Brigg (SS54/159).

country,,,,,,,," Country is a word that was brought here by the Normans but had its origin in the Latin <i>contra</i>; that is ‘against’. It was a word therefore which described what lay in front of a person, the landscape that is: from this developed a number of related meanings, including what is possibly now its best known definition, that is a nation or state. In many contexts country formerly referred more often to regions or districts of varying sizes: in a Cheshire glossary of 1887 the point was made that ‘two adjoining parishes might be spoken of as different countries’ and much earlier, in 1534, the author of a book on husbandry said that ‘In Leycestershyre, Lankesshyre, Yorkeshyre … and manye other countreyes, the plowes be of dyvers makinges’ (FH10). In 1547, when George Carter of Grinton wrote <i>Yt Ys my mynd that when Jeffrey my sonne commeys into the countre that he … shall gyve Janet my dowghter 13s 4d,</i> he no doubt meant when Jeffrey returned to Grinton parish (YRS152/65). </br>Such ‘countries’ might be defined in a wide variety of ways; by the topography, by manorial allegiance or by regional occupations, and they were likely to have their own customs and practices. In the early 1500s, for example, before the growing influence of statutory law, wills and deeds regularly contained phrases such as ‘after the use of the contre’ or ‘after the costome of the contre’. When a West Riding man named John Thewlis was arrested in Chester, <i>c.</i>1530, he was accused of counterfeiting, and put into prison. He could have expected severe punishment but was released after the mayor and recorder of the city received letters from Sir Henry Savile of Thornhill, more or less demanding that the man be set free (YRS51/35). The wording more than hints at corruption, for Sir Henry suggested to them that they <i>shuld beare there lawfull favour unto Thewles as he might do likewise for them in his cuntrye.</i> It would be interesting to know whether this was the clothier John Thewlis whose name later features in <i>The Caernarvonshire Quarter Sessions Records as an established English burgess.",custom of the country; day-tale,FH10,,1534,np,YRS152/65,,1547,Grinton,YRS51/35,,c.1530,Thornhill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

couple,coupling,,,,,, In a timber-framed house the couples were the rafters which met at the ridge: they could be joined at the base by a tie beam.,"Possible early references are: 1381 ‘shall build that house of length <i>22 copells</i>’, Yeadon (SW71); 1446-7 <i>j cowpelewall et iij screnes infra eandem tenementum</i>, Beverley (ERAS6/76). As a verb it meant to fasten together with wood or secure with wood and the word occurs in mining records from the early eighteenth century: 1718 <i>two days to couple through the fall</i>; 1720 <i>Couplings 2s 0d</i>, Farnley (MS11,14). More explicitly ‘couples’ occur in connection with puncheons, that is wooden pit-props: 1730 <i>put in the Punchions and couple them</i>, Swillington (CKY37); 1760 <i>pd miners setting puncheons and Cupplings in the down End and upper end 9s</i>, Tong (Mss4c/5). As with ‘puncheon’ the likelihood is that the word was ‘borrowed’ from  the carpenters’ house-building vocabulary, although just how the props were coupled or supported is not absolutely clear – perhaps in chevrons or, as Gresley says ‘Two props and a bar placed across the tops of them’.  In the carpenter’s account for Cottingley Bridge in 1682 was the following item:</br><i> For wood finding and workmanship to Lay over the River and to be well piled downe there and placed Three Yards below the old wood frame and to be Fastned with Coupleing the same sufficiently to the old frame with wood att every Foure yards in Length</i> (QS1/21/5).",,SW71,,1381,Yeadon,ERAS6/76,,1446-7,Beverley,MS11,,1718,Farnley,MS14,,1720,Farnley,CKY37,,1730,Swillington,Mss4c/5,,1760,Tong,QS1/21/5,,1682,Cottingley Bridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Cow Shutt Fen, Methley",,,,,,,,"The earliest spellings of this place-name occur in the manorial court rolls in the 1500s. In 1525 the hedges in Cutler Lane had to be trimmed so that tenants might <i>carry hay from Cowshotfen … as they had been accustomed</i> (Th35/197) and in 1541 tenants who had meadow in <i>Cowshotfen</i> were ordered to transport stone to two local lanes where repairs were being carried out (Th35/205). The number of wain loads depended on the number of acres in their possession so it was an obligation of their tenure, which suggests that <i>Cowshotfen</i> was part of the town’s common meadow. The fact that it was ‘town’ land persuaded Smith that ‘shot’ should be interpreted as ‘shut’, that is a division of land, but this word referred to arable and not meadow so an alternative explanation may be required.</br>A clue to the origin can be found in the advice on matters of husbandry that John Kaye of Woodsome gave to his children <i>c</i>.1570: <i>scarr</i> [scare] <i>the cowshott and the craw from thy pure wheat, </i>a recommendation that bird-scarers should be employed when the wheat was almost ready to harvest (KayeCP). The ‘cowshott’ was the voracious wood pigeon, a regional term on record from the Old English period, listed as ‘cushat’ in the OED but with a 400-year gap in the evidence.</br>That space can be occupied by minor place-names from townships in and around Wakefield, all of them close to Methley. In 1324 ‘Henry de Swillington had licence to take a piece of land and meadow in Alvirthorp … called <i>Coushotedole</i>’ (YRS109/47); in 1333 Margery Mote surrendered several pieces of land in Stanley ‘into the hand of the lord’ which included ‘a rood called <i>Couchotrode</i>’ (WCR3/167), and in 1364 an acre of land held by Robert Walker of Wakefield in Ossett ‘abutted on <i>le Couschotcliff</i>’ (YRS39/127). In all these minor names and also in Methley, I believe, the reference is to the wood pigeon. The origin of ‘cushat’ remains obscure but there is no doubt that the bird was commonly known by that name in and around Wakefield and it would have foraged in the low-lying fens between the Aire and the Calder.",,Th35/197,,1525,Methley,Th35/205,,1541,Methley,KayeCp,,c.1570,Woodsome,YRS109/47,,1324,Alvirthorp,WCR3/167,,1333,Stanley,YRS39/127,,1364,Ossett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wood was being used by mill-wrights in the early sixteenth century for making ‘cogges and ronges’ (OED) and was recommended in 1742 for its ‘hardness and duration’ (FWT41). In fact crab-trees were grown in some spring woods and Sir Henry Cholmeley sowed <i>ash chats & Crab cernells</i> in 1653-4 (Mss3/210).

The combination also gave rise to a by-name: 1229-34 <i>Simon de Cringeleker</i>, Burnsall (EYCh7/159). </br>It was also linked with <i>mýrr </i>which similarly referred to marshy areas: <i>c</i>.1290 ‘<i>Brademire</i> and <i>Cringelmire </i>with adjacent meadows’, Farnley near Otley (YRS120/74); 1407 <i>cringlemyre</i> (PNWR7/216); 1507 <i>for the cryngyll now in the occupacon of Thos Taylo</i>[u]<i>r … for the cryngyll myer in the occupacon of John Quintaunce</i>, Temple Newsam (Th33/62).

crochon,,,,,,," In the Fountains Abbey records ‘crochon’ is one spelling of a word that occurs numerous times in the ‘Expenses of the master of the cattle’, often alongside ‘drape’.","1456-7 <i>pro custodia de Crochuuse </i>[sic] <i>… in consimili pro drapis</i> (SS130/10); 1496 <i>lez Crochons</i>, Bewerley (FAR4); 1537 <i>ix crochone kye</i>, Birthwaite (SS42/278). The meaning of ‘crochon’ is evident in the abbey leases which provide a great deal of information about livestock and farming practices. These documents refer to the ‘renewing’ of the herds at twelve-month intervals, with arrangements made for the older animals to be exchanged for younger ones. Typically <i>nine of the oldest and most crochy kye</i> were put into the care of the chief herdsman and replaced later by nine heifers, <i>to fulfyll the stynt</i> (SS42/278). </br>The ‘crochons’ or older beasts were then moved to good pasture at Whitsuntide and fattened there in preparation for their slaughter in the autumn. It is a word that I have found only in the western Dales and it is responsible there for several distinctive place-names, most obviously several fields named Crutching Close, in Langcliffe, Rylstone and Settle, and Crutchon Close in Halton Gill. Less directly it explains Crutchin Gill in Horton in Ribblesdale and Crutchenber Fell in Slaidburn. A connection with the word ‘crock’ used for old ewes in 1528 and later for broken-down horses seems likely.</br>Ironically, because certain examples were mistakenly transcribed as ‘crochous’ and ‘crochuuse’ the word was taken by one editor to be a place-name, with the suffix ‘house’: Smith listed ‘crochuuse’ as a spelling of Crooke in Halton Gill, failing to recognise the connection with Crutchon close which he rightly placed among the field names (PNWR6/123).

Crown Flatt,Crown Lands,crum,crumb,,,,," Smith listed these two West Riding place-names, one in Ossett and the other in Dewsbury, but he offered no explanation of their meaning. He compared the two and was apparently satisfied that ‘Crown’ could be taken at face value. I believe he was wrong and that the first element is more likely to be Old English <i>crumb</i> meaning ‘bent’ or ‘crooked’. Early examples of this element are on record, for example: 1219 <i>Crumelandis</i>, Crofton (PNWR2/114); 1236 <i>Crumbacre</i>, Kirkleatham (YRS62/21,146); 1346 <i>one rood called Croumbeland</i>, Bingley (YRS76/8). Other early references are undated but clearly from the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries: they include: <i>Crumbacre</i>, Barforth (YRS102/12); <i>Crumlandis</i>, Brinsworth (PNWR1/179) and <i>Crumlandes</i>, Ardsley (YRS66/55). Where a sequence of names is available the transition from ‘crumb’ to ‘crown’ is implicit. In Ossett: 1538 <i>a half rood of land lying on Crowmeland butt</i> (WCR9/109); 1584 <i>one selion lies on Crownelandes</i> (WCR4/24). Similarly in Huddersfield: 1549 <i>Cromlaundes</i> (DD/R/1/14); 1607 <i>Crownlands</i> (DD/R/5/16). The context in these cases links the names with the open field, probably referring to ‘shuts’ or groups of strips which either had a pronounced bend or traversed a hummock. In some cases what had been a generic became a distinctive place-name: ‘crumb’ was replaced by ‘crown’ when the meaning was no longer transparent.

currier,currier craft,,,,,, The currier was the tradesman who dressed leather after it had been tanned.,"It is a word with a complicated spelling history but derives ultimately from the Latin word for tanner and it was brought here in the post-Conquest period.

The clear inference is that it referred to a cairn or heap of stones and it must therefore be considered alongside ‘hurrock’ which has the same meaning and is dealt with separately. It is not a transcription error but seems more likely to preserve a local pronunciation. In <i>Swaledale: Valley of the Wild River</i> (1998) the author Andrew Fleming more than once wrote of ‘hurrocks or curracks’ and more recently the term was again recorded in a boundary description: 1705-8 <i>from thence the bounder of Grinton mannor proceeds ... to Windyate Currack thence to Summerlodge Tarne Currock</i> (YRS162/106).

custom of the country,,,,,,, People formerly used the word ‘country’ of the district in which they lived and grew up.," It was an area larger than the parish and might include several market towns but it had no defined boundaries: it was home to neighbours, family, friends, and working companions; a region defined by common experience. Within such regions there were local customs that governed social life and working practices: 1455 <i>I wite for my sone Cristofere that he have the principalles of my gudes as the custom of the countree is,</i> Kirkby Fleetham (SS30/215). From the Tudor period such customs gave way reluctantly to statutory requirements. For example, the first Act that sought to regulate wood management nationwide was passed in 1543, after which the practices were subject to the law, in theory at least. The conflict between ‘the custom of the country’ and ‘the King his statute’ is then apparent in the wording of documents. In 1527, before the passing of the Act, Sir Godfrey Foljambe leased his springwoods to Richard Beaumont of Whitley and the deed required the purchaser to work <i>after the use and custom of the contree </i>(WBD/3/32): similarly, in <i>c</i>.1540 any lessee of <i>Hampall high woode</i> was <i>to leave the woods accordynge to the custome of the countre</i> (YRS80/122). A deed of 1549, just after the Act, compromised by ordering the purchasers to <i>wave the woods accordynge to the Kyng his statute and the custom of the countre </i>(WBD/8/60). In coal-mining no similar law was passed and local practices carried on into the nineteenth century: 1653 <i>liberty to … Sinck or make any Colle Pittes or Collery … according to the Custome of the Countrey</i>, Ingleton (GRD); 1713 <i>the pitt has been shamefully wrought, much longer than usual or necessary considering the custom of the country and the thinness of the coal beds</i>, Shibden (HAS30/143); 1797 <i>sunk and worked in an ingenious and workmanlike manner according to the custom of the country</i>, Shibden (HAS31/86). An item under ‘board’ is evidence that customs were broken but the West Riding cannot be compared with the Forest of Dean or the lead-mining areas of Mendip, Derbyshire and Alston Moor, in all of which mining was subject to long-established laws and practices (R&J92).",fork; unpilled,SS30/215,,1455,Kirkby Fleetham,WBD/3/32,,1527,Whitley,YRS80/122,,c.1540,Hampall high wood,WBD/8/60,,1549,np,GRD,,1653,Ingleton,HAS30/143,,1713,Shibden,HAS31/86,,1797,Shibden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
customer,,,,,,,,"The word has had several distinct meanings. In the court roll for Colne in 1540 it was ordered that the <i>Customers of the old tenur</i> should be summoned to attend at Michaelmas (WF1/344). In that archaic sense of the word the customer was a tenant of long standing, a customary holder. Latin examples are found in very early undated charters: <i>ita quod Willelmus de Percy nec heredes sui vel custumarii sui de Tatecastr</i> (YRS92/166). </br>The word was also used in connection with the Custom House at Hull; the title of the officers who collected the customs or tolls paid by ship-owners. In 1521, a man named Thomas Annesley was said to have been <i>custumer of Kyngeston uppon Hull by the space of viij yeres and an hallf</i>(YRS45/1). It was already an ancient tradition: 1457 <i>Item thay payd to the cosstomars and to the clarkes at Hull ... xlvs stirlyng,</i> York (SS129/62): a rental of 1465 shows that <i>the Custoumers for two chambers called the Customhouses</i> paid 26s 8d (YRS141/111). The Merchant Adventurers of York were in dispute with Hull in the 1540s and the Governor of Hull wrote the following letter: 1548-9 <i>I understand that the merchant men of … Yorke fynd themselves gryved, for that they ar exacted to paye more for the costom of ther lead within the port of Hull than heretofore hath beyne by the costomers there required </i>(SS129/138). It remained a Hull institution: in 1594 <i>William Johns, Customer,</i> was buried at St Mary’s, Hull (YAJ12/465). </br>Now, we use the word to describe any person who purchases goods in a place of sale whereas formerly it referred to a frequent buyer, one who customarily purchased from a particular tradesman: 1658 <i>to Elizabeth Rodes my gowne, if she continue my sonnes costomer one yeare & a halfe</i>, Selby (YRS47/128). In 1699, Sir Walter Calverley fined a tenant five shillings for a trespass but then returned the money to him, saying <i>he was a customer to my mills with his cloath</i> (SS77/83). The transition towards these two related meanings is evident in a legal opinion expressed in 1717: it referred to an estate owner called Ramsden who feared losing <i>Customers for his fulling mill</i> as a result of decreased water power (DD/R).

cut (2),,,,,,, A passage or channel; an artificial watercourse.,"The word occurs in early place-names: <i>c</i>.1235 <i>tres perticatas in Cutthesik</i>, Whitwood (YRS30/670).

It occurs as a verb at an early date: 1649 <i>to Cutt the said banck, sandbed or stayner thorough and demolish it</i>, Horbury (OWR1/1/27). When bridges collapsed it was often because the even flow of water through the arches had been disturbed and the foundations of pillars and abutments weakened. The records show that attempts were frequently made to stop this happening by changing the course of the water and there is explicit information in a document relating to Bishopton Bridge. In 1754, the usual course of the River Laver had been diverted by <i>frequent floods and the rapidity of the rivulet, </i>and a report at the Quarter Sessions contained the following information about the need for a cut:</br><i>The rivulet … will in a short time wash away the High Road leading from Pateley Bridge through Bishopton Ellers towards Ripon </i>[and]<i> the large beds of gravell and stone that are thrown up … will obstruct the same in its course … and the river will get behind the wall built for the security of the bridge … unless a proper cut be made thro’ the said beds of gravel and stone to carry the said river thro’ the said bridge</i>(QS1/93/82).</br>Previously, in 1683, <i>a great Trench or Cutt </i>was made<i> to bring the River Ure more directly to Hewick Bridge </i>(QS1) and similarly it was agreed in 1712 <i>to bring the River </i>[Aire]<i> into a straight course </i>by making<i> two Cutts thorow the grounds </i>of a local estate (QS1/51/4).

cutler,,,,,,,"One who makes knives and other cutting utensils, from the French <i>coutel</i> meaning knife.","The OED quotes Leland (1538) who wrote: <i>Ther be many Smithes and Cuttelars in Halamshire</i>, and also lists two earlier uses of the word, from <i>c</i>.1400 and <i>c</i>.1430. However, the occupational surname is on record in the Sheffield area more than a century earlier: 1297 <i>Robertus le Coteler</i>, Sheffield (YRS16/76); 1333 <i>Adam Coteler</i>, Sheffield (TWH11/9). In the poll tax both the surname and occupation were well established there: 1379 <i>Johannes Coteler</i>, Sheffield; <i>Ricardus Hyngham, cotteler</i>, Ecclesfield (PTWR). Several other taxpayers were listed on that occasion, including <i>Thomas Hauk</i>’ <i>coteler</i> of Handsworth who paid 12d, that is three times the standard rate. It should be noted that there were cutlers in York from the late thirteenth century: 1298 <i>Johannes de Brampton, coteller</i> (SS96/7) and frequently thereafter. The possibility is that some of these were retailing ‘cutlery’ rather than producing it: 1334 <i>Adam de Ireland, cotoler vel haberdasscher</i> (SS96/30). Other cutlers were recorded in many parts of the West Riding in the poll tax of 1379; in Beeston, Pontefract, Ripon, Selby and several small villages, a clear indication of how widespread the occupation then was. One interesting group was in the small township of Ferry Fryston: it included <i>Johannes Coteller, smyth</i>, several families with <i>Coteller</i> as a by-name, six additional smiths who paid tax as tradesmen, and <i>Johannes de Breres, shethe</i>r (PTWR). The spelling ‘cutler’ was recorded occasionally in the early period and it had become the conventional form by the sixteenth century: 1441 <i>Richard Cuteler</i>, Darnall (TWH13/37); 1496 Richard Bower of Ecclesall, <i>cuttelar</i> (WPS166); 1540 <i>Thomas Creswyke of Olerton, cuttler</i> (TWH20/42). It is likely that throughout that period the cutlers were making items such as scissors and scythes which would later become the work of specialist craftsmen, and that they did their own grinding. They were in any case distinct from the farriers and smiths whose work ranged from shoeing horses to fashioning locks and arrowheads.

In 1621, a bill was presented to Parliament and three years later an Act was passed which made provision for the appointment of officers; that is one Master, two Wardens, six Searchers and twenty-four Assistants. It was an institution for which there were the medieval precedents of the Companies of Cutlers in London and York and its main functions were to enrol apprentices, admit freemen, make orders and act on behalf of the members, individually and collectively. The Cutlers’ Hall is the headquarters of the Company and it has served the cutlers in Hallamshire from 1638, although the present building dates only from 1832.

dam,,,,,,," In Yorkshire the ‘dam’ was usually the pond or reservoir at a mill or water wheel, rather than the bank which held back the water, although occasionally it probably had that meaning.","1366-7 ‘a dovecot lying by <i>le Dam</i> in the vill of Pontefract’ (YRS76/184); 1549 <i>to make a substantyall dame or weyr</i>, Ashton Carr (Miller86). In fact the early evidence indicates that the word was probably employed as a verb, meaning to obstruct the flow of a stream. There could be a variety of reasons for doing that but mostly the connections are with the confinement of water in an artificial pond, so as to make it available to turn a water wheel. An undated thirteenth-century land grant for Aughton near Rotherham, mentions ‘half an acre at <i>le Dam</i>’ and the context there suggests that it referred to a ‘pond’ (YAJ12/102). Similarly, in Selby, the Latin word <i>stagnum</i> was consistently used from the fourteenth century for the abbey’s mill dam, and an indenture between the archbishop and the abbot has; 1321 <i>de stagno vocato le Damme</i> (YRS10/4). The waterway which feeds the dam is also known as Selby Dam.  When water power was harnessed for industrial purposes, the dams and associated goits or water courses were often mentioned in leases; 1705 <i>shall well and sufficiently keep, scour and Repaire all manner of Dams, goyts, streams, water banks</i>, Wortley Forge (SpSt). In 1736, Joshua Spooner, grinder, took a 21-year lease of the Second Coppice Wheel in the Rivelin Valley which allowed him <i>to build a new cutlers wheel with one end and as many troughs as he might think proper with all ways, dams goits requisite for the said wheel</i> (WPS85). In Sheffield the area by the river Sheaf known as ‘The Ponds’ was exceptional in giving rise to the name Pond Mill, a manorial corn mill (WPSxviii).",attach; damstead; goit; pentrough; shuttle; smithies,YRS76/184,,1366-7,Pontefract,Miller86,,1549,Ashton Carr,YAJ12/102,,nd,Aughton near Rotherham,YRS10/4,,1321,Selby,SpSt,,1705,Wortley Forge,WPS85,,1736,Rivelin Valley,WPSxviii,,nd,Sheffield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damage,,,,,,, From the eighteenth century coal-owners were granted rights which related to stacking coal and pit waste and opening up ways through fields where no such liberty had previously existed. Provision was made lest ‘damage’ be done to a tenant’s land.,"The following document has to do with such an incident: 1755 <i>Due to John Bentley for Damage by him sustained on Account of the said Coalpits … by John Beatson of Cottingley Hall</i>. Two independent arbitrators were asked <i>to view two Closes … the Low Intake and Thornhill Head and to estimate the Damage done … by Coalpit ways</i>. The sum they decided on was £15 4s 0d which took account of the <i>Rent at Assessment, Plowings and Coggings, Sowing with Wheat, Manure, Loam</i> and <i>Lime</i> (DB129/4). However, the concern for damage that might be done to farm land goes back to the earliest years of coal-mining; 1597 <i>Compensation 20s for every acre of the premises diggid, broken upp, defacyd, trodden</i>, Beeston (DB129/4).

damask (2) ,,,,,,,The verb to ‘damask’ shares the same origin as the fabric of that name but it meant to decorate a metal object with designs which were cut into the surface and filled with gold or silver.,"1450 <i>optimum ciphum meum coopertum et deauratum et chaceatum cum opere Damasci</i>, Beverley (SS30/140). In the cutlery trade it was to decorate the blade of a knife or sword. 1586 <i>a Case of pystoles gylded and Dammaske with flaske and furnituer for the same</i>, Sheffield (TWH14/261). It occurs in the records of the Cutlers’ Jury in 1614, when Adam Bate was fined <i>for damasking of low priced kniues with silver wire</i> (HCC5) and it was carried over into the by-laws of the Cutlers’ Company. 1625 <i>None to damaske, inlay or Studd … any knives or wares, or intermixe the same with any Pewter, Tinn, Lead, Brass or other Counterfeit Stuff</i> (HCC9). A much earlier entry in the York chamberlains’ accounts appears to link the two meanings of this word, for it records the purchase of ‘damask’ to decorate the sheath of the Mayor’s sword.  1453-4 <i>Et j quart’ damask empto pro cooptura vagine gladii maioris … et pro suicione eiusdem … ac pro argent’ deauracione</i> (SS192/83).",chase (2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
damp,choke-damp,,,,,," This is a miners’ term for two quite different gases; that is carbonic acid gas, sometimes called ‘choke-damp’ and carburetted hydrogen or marsh gas, also known as ‘fire-damp’."," In both cases evidence for the word is quite late and the first examples quoted in the OED are 1626 and 1665. Sadly, there are several burial registers in Yorkshire which provide earlier evidence: 1594 <i>Thomas Illingworth of Cottingley who died in a Colepyt at Norre with a dampe</i>, Bingley (PR); 1597 <i>Richard Mankenoole sonn smored [smothered] with the dampe and buryed</i>, Leeds (PR). The Elland register also has examples, including 1625 <i>Richard Hartley, carbonarius suffocatus fumo vulgo Dampe </i>(PR). These deaths were probably caused by choke-damp and there is further evidence of the danger that it posed in a poignant account of an accident at Norwood Green, near Halifax. It was written by the minister, the Rev. Oliver Heywood. </br><i>1673 Thomas Oates having sunk a cole-pit near his hous … let down one George Harrison to get out some water … being got to the bottom his breath was almost gone with the damp, he called to be pulled up again, they drew, but as he was ascending he let hold of the rope goe and dropt down to the bottom.

Tho Oates cryed out will no one go to fetch my child out of the pit? At last James Mitchell was willing to be let down, but coming near the middle his breath beginning to be stopt, cryed out to be pulled up, who coming up lay overpowered at the top, panting for breath a good while, at last they persuaded one William Whitiker to goe down, he did so, and stirred in the water … perceived they were alive, the rope was let down, G Harrison was drawn up, alive, onely his head wounded with the fall, then they drew up James Oates who went by himself into the house was laid upon the bed, both of them … likely to live, blessed be god</i> (OH1/351-2).</br> The damp sometimes delayed work 1713 <i>Before the new pitt was sunke the workmen were frequently forced to leave the work by reason of the damp</i>, Shibden (HAS30/142) and in 1718 a payment of 1s 6d was recorded in the accounts for <i>Ale when they stopt damp</i>, Farnley (MS14).

His recommendation in 1642 was to purchase deals that were <i>seasoned and not greene</i>; he warned against <i>new deales … bought and solde immediately … whiles the shippe … is yett in the haven</i>. There were added advantages, for seasoned wood weighed less and the expense involved in its carriage was much lower.

dearbought ,,,,,,,"The OED gives the meaning of dear-bought as ‘bought at a high price, obtained at great cost’, and quotes Chaucer’s use of it in <i>c.</i>1384.","It is actually a relatively common field-name, and Yorkshire examples date from the thirteenth century: 1240 ‘their culture called <i>Dereboch’t</i>', Kirkheaton (Font364); 1622 <i>Dearebought</i>, Kilnsey (MD247); 1847 <i>Dear bought</i>, Kettlewell (PNWR6/111). Different interpretations have been suggested Smith considered that the Kettlewell field had been so named because it was expensive whereas John Field thought the name was generally derogatory, a nickname for land regarded as a poor bargain; he quoted references in Cambridge, Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Lancashire and Norfolk (JF61). </b>These are both possible interpretations, with meanings supported in general by early material in the OED, but the names were not met with in contexts which offered any insights into a more precise derivation. Since ‘Dearbought’ occurred frequently and over a long period, right across England, it was evidently in more common colloquial use than the few dictionary references imply. It is fortunate therefore that the parson of Melmerby used the term in his description of how peat was ‘won’ from moors in the North Pennines: 1677 <i>as the saying is, they are dear bought for wee bring them two miles or more along & downe the craggie and steep mountaine in our trucke-carres to a place … whence when fully dried wee fetch them home in wheele-cartes</i> (AW126). These were hard-won peats, and the emphasis is not on expense but the difficulty with which they were brought home and the time taken. In this context the meaning is more positive than the inferences made by Field and Smith, and it may be that ‘dear bought’ as a minor place-name emphasises time spent and hard labour rather than money unwisely laid out. The phrase 'as the saying is' clarifies the role that 'dear bought' once had in our everyday vocabulary.

dearn,dern,,,,,, A door-post in many parts of England (OED) but that is rarely the meaning in Yorkshire.,"For example, in a deed of 1549-50, William Lockwood and his wife, of Linthwaite Hall, were held responsible for making <i>the west derne of lane yate and all the fenses betwixt the derne and one close called Ridynges</i> (RAD62). The ‘yate’ was a gate and the ‘derne’ was therefore a gatepost. A second reference from that period has the same meaning: 1555 <i>from the east end of the yate dearne to the east syde of the mystall</i>, Thurstonland (G-A).</br> In Rastrick the term was used in connection with the gate of the town pinfold: 1609 <i>make for the kings pound in Rastrick a yate with sufficiente dearns and a good locke and keye of the townes charge</i> (WCR11/173). These ‘dearns’ will have been made of wood, especially since the Rastrick overseers were ordered to maintain <i>the rales and fence</i> of the pinfold. Occasionally, a dearn could be a wooden pillar: in 1627 <i>a stoop or dearne of wood was anciently sett in the ground close by … to distinguish this</i> [dike] <i>from other little rivers</i>, Lingards (DT211). Quite frequently ‘dearns’ were referred to in pairs:  1681 <i>A yate att the end of the greate dole adjoyneing to the westfeild with two dearnes to hange itt to come and goe</i>, Kirkheaton (WBR/11).</br> Occasionally, the spelling was closer to examples quoted in the OED, and the meaning could be door-post: 1603 <i>the dore dearne</i>, Netherthong (G-A); 1671 <i>two new Dornes [sic] for the Doore into the vault</i>, Elland (PR3/385). The word is possibly the source of the Lindley place-name Dearne Fold, for which spellings survive only from the seventeenth century: 1667 <i>William Morehous de Dearne de Lynley</i> (PR); 1701 <i>All that messuage called by the name of the Dearne and all houses, edifices, buildings, folds … adjoining to the said house</i>, Lindley (MD234).

ding (2) ,,,,,,,"In Selby there were ‘dings’ from 1658, and they were evidently two-storey buildings which functioned as warehouses.","In the inventory of 1676 attached to the will of John Chambers:  <i>In the chamber over the Saltding, 500 of fir deale … in the Salt Ding, 8 weigh of salt</i> (YRS47/41). A rental for Hull in 1527-8 has five entries under <i>The Dyngges</i> each of them a shop, and an earlier rental (1465) also lists <i>a shoppe in the Dyngges</i>:  an editorial footnote indicates that the name may have been on record there from 1365 when only drapers might lease the shops. They stood at the east end of Holy Trinity church (YRS141). </br>In Beverley, the history of the word goes back to 1165 at least and it referred there to a hall in the market place (VHER6). This belonged to the Archbishop of York who held the lordship of the town, and the hall served as both a residence and administrative centre. In 1282, this building was described as <i>Byscopding</i> when it was leased to the townsmen (SS114/283):  the archbishop moved his headquarters to Hall Garth, a moated site south of the minster and the property was adapted to other uses. </br> In 1408, the rents <i>issuing from the Dynges</i> in Beverley amounted to 66s 8d (YRS59/80) and the inference is that the hall had been divided into several tenements that were already being used commercially or as shops. In the Beverley Corporation Book it was ordered in 1722 that <i>no lease be made of any shop in the Dings to any person keeping a blacksmith’s shop, a common bakehouse or a heckler shop</i>:  in 1772 the <i>Signe of the Fox</i> was a public-house in the Dings. The buildings were sold by the corporation in the early 1800s (YRS122). It is worth noting that in 1799 they subscribed <i>15 guineas towards flagging the Butter Dings</i> (YRS122/82) for Butter Ding Flags survived as a street name, on the east side of Saturday Market.</br> Until recently there was no satisfactory explanation of this word:  A.H. Smith thought that it might be Scandinavian in origin, probably meaning dung or dung-heap, (PNER197) but that never seemed likely given the connection with the Archbishop's residence. A more plausible explanation identifies it as a word derived from Old Norse <i>dyngja</i>, meaning a cellared building (EPNJ46). It remains uncertain whether the ‘dings’ in Hull and Selby had independent origins but it seems possible that they were transferred to those places from Beverley, in the way that some other street names passed into more general use. The narrow area in which ‘ding’ occurs, along the Ouse and its feeders, lends some support to that view, with 'salt-ding' as an active vocabulary item in Selby in the 1600s.",,YRS47/41,,1676,np,YRS141,,1527-8 1465 1365,Hull,VHER,,1165,Beverley,SS114/283,,1282,Beverley,YRS59/80,,1408,Beverley,YRS122,,1772,Beverley,YRS122/82,,1799,Beverley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dodded,dodderd,dodderell ,doted,dottard,dotted,dotterel (1),"The verb ‘to dod’ is on record from the early thirteenth century when it was used in connection with having one’s hair cut, and by <i>c</i>.1440 it occurred with reference to trees that had been polled or lopped (OED). ","It is found in Yorkshire from the sixteenth century, perhaps with that meaning, although 'decayed' is also a possibility: 1545 <i>lxxx dodded trees sold … for fyre wodd</i>, Spaunton (DD/RA/f/4a). However, it cannot easily be distinguished from a number of similar words, all of which had to do with trees which had lost their branches, usually through decay or age, and the OED has individual entries for each of these.

The examples of 1568 and 1603 are from Yorkshire sources, and references in the county’s records suggest that these words are difficult to separate in meaning. For example, in the Accounts of the Woodward General, 1544-5, the entries are in the same hand and ‘dodded’ which has already been quoted is paralleled by <i>olde dotted trees</i> and <i>olde dotterd trees</i> (DD/RA/f/4a). An Almondbury survey of 1584 has <i>a few old doted trees which are good for nothing except it be for the fire</i> (MS205). A list of woods in Bilsdale for 1642 has <i>dodderell okes, dotterd okes and dodderd okes</i> (NYRO23/66-9) and accounts for Pickering Forest have similar forms: 1608 <i>dottards</i>, 1660 <i>old Dotterells</i> (NRR1/12,71). The words may have been used interchangeably but they do not have a common origin: ‘dotard’ and similar terms derive ultimately from the verb ‘to dote’, that is to be out of one’s wits or weak-minded.

dog  ,,,,,,,,"The OED has ‘dog’ from 1883 for a spike used to fasten down rails on sleepers, and ‘dog-nail’ from 1703, used for fastening hinges or other iron work: the common element seems to be their power to grip, securing one object to another. In 1576, 20 pence was paid <i>for a dogge of yron nailed on the joynynge of two panes in the new house</i>, York (SS35/116) and this evidently had a similar meaning.

dogdrave ,,,,,,,"Of uncertain origin, although certainly a catch of fish made in the North Sea. ","A ‘drave’ was a fishing expedition and it has been suggested that ‘dogdrave’ was a reference to cod caught in the area now called the Dogger Bank. In many early spellings the suffix might be a form of ‘draw’; that is ‘haul aboard’. The word is apparently mentioned in an agreement with the Scarborough fishermen in 1251 (NHR3/56) and the OED has a reference dated 1227 which points to it as the name of the fishery (ad piscariam de doggedragh). It is a regular entry in the accounts of Bolton Priory, although apparently for a number of fish: 1301-2 <i>In ij laystes di. et d. allec(ibus) salsatis ... In ccc dogdraves</i> (YRS154/128); 1314-5 <i>Pro cccc dogdragh’ emptis apud Hertelpole vj.li </i>(YRS154/384). There is some evidence that ‘dogge’ was a Dutch word for the cod.

dog pits,,,,,,,A common minor place-name with no very early references.,"Dog Pots Plantation in the township of Nidd, Dog Pits in Brearton and the Minskip field name Dog Pits are three of the names recorded by Smith in his work on West Riding place-names (PNWR5) but the evidence for them is late. One or two earlier examples are on record, in Barwick in Elmet for example, which has <i>Dog Pitt Close</i> listed in a terrier of 1693 (Th17/93) and in Tong where <i>Dog Pitt Close</i> is shown on the 1725 estate map, sited near to the hall, tenanted by Peter Ver (Mss9/2). The repeated use of the name is a clear indication that it referred to some commonplace feature of the landscape, and Smith’s suggestion that it ‘presumably denoted a pit frequented by dogs’ (PNWR5/98) is hardly satisfactory. </br>The function of the dog pit is made clear in a North Bierley lease of 1618, in which the highway to Bradford was said to lead <i>upward by a little runninge water on the south to a pitt made for keepinge of horsflesh, heretofore for the hounds of William Rookes of Roodes Hall </i>(MM/A/239). The practice of feeding hounds on horse flesh has continued until the present day and there are clear references to it in local estate records. In 1745, for example, a payment of 13 shillings was made at Whitley Beaumont to John Jessop <i>for Horses for the Doggs</i> (WBE/1/19) and in 1772 the Mirfield diarist John Turner wrote <i>Bawle my good old horse died aged 23. Thomas Shaw had him for hounds</i> (MS757). </br> The North Bierley lease of 1618 quoted above makes it clear that such pits served as storage places for the horse flesh before it was fed to the dogs, so we should look for the place-name close to the kennels or the dog-keeper’s cottage. It is worth noting that in Tong the field named Dog Pitts Close lies immediately to the south of Keeper Lane and some distance from the hall. The noise created by the dogs when they were feeding might partly explain that. Norristhorpe near Liversedge has the by-name ‘Doggus’ locally; that is dog house, and this must surely be where the dogs for Liversedge Hall were kept (Peel132). A deed records the sale of <i>the messuage called Doghouse in Liversedge</i> to Sir John Armytage of Kirklees in 1725 (KM/844/a). In 1560, Ralph Hawkesworth surrendered one messuage called <i>Dogghouse</i> in Thornsett (HS1/321).",,Th17/93,,1693,Barwick in Elmet,Mss9/2,,1725,Tong,MM/A/239,,1618,Bradford,WBE/1/19,,1745,Whitley Beaumont,MS757,,1772,Mirfield,KM/844/a,,1725,Liversedge,HS1/321,,1560,Thornsett,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

drape ,,,,,,,"Found usually in farming contexts, this was a word for a cow or sheep taken out of the herd or flock to be fatted for slaughter."," It was used particularly for cows which no longer produced milk and for ewes that had missed breeding. The OED has examples from 1611, all of them in the north of England, but the term was in widespread use across Yorkshire from much earlier.: 1418 <i> Item, de drapes abstratis xxxij, precium capitis xiiijd,</i> Welwick (SS116/25); 1458-9 <i> Apud Apylgarth draps, viijd </i> (SS130/88). The latter is one of several references in the records of Fountains Abbey, and ‘Applegarth’ referred to a sheep pasture of that name in Malham. </b> Those examples seem likely to have referred to sheep but more usually ‘drapes’ were cattle. A new cattle fair was announced in York in 1502, to be held in Fishergate, away from the places where horses and sheep were put up for sale. The animals included M <i>all maner nowte as fatte nowte, drapez or yong stote</i> (YRS103/174). The 1559 inventory of Cuthbert Clarkson of Marske in Swaledale separated the cows from the sheep and listed <i>2 new calved kye, 3 whies,</i> and <i> 1 drape cow praysed </I>[valued]<i> to 20s</i> (YRS152/107). Similarly, in the seventeenth century we find: 1628 <i> one whyte drape cowe,</i> Pudsey (LRS1/77); <i> 1657 tow drape kyen £5,</i> Hambleton (YRS47/109). I suspect that the word was not always recognised by transcribers: 1666 <i>1 draxe cow and 3 spained calfies, £4, </i> Brayton (YRS47/75). </b>
In the farming accounts of Henry Best of Elmswell, in the East Riding, is a paragraph which relates to sheep, where ‘drape’ is employed as a verb: 1642 <i>When the worst of the flocke are drawne out, the Shepheards call this drapinge out of sheepe, and some drape out a score to putte of by reason of their age, some because their grownd is overstocked and therefore they will sell away the worst </i>(DW76).  He commented later that most East Riding farmers would <i>drape out the worst of theire lambs </i> and send them to the fair at Pocklington (DW119). His observations widen the meaning of ‘drape’.</b>
The etymology of the word is uncertain but the OED draws attention to an obsolete verb ‘drepe’ which is of Scandinavian origin and meant ‘to strike’ or ‘slaughter’. A rare by-name confirms that this word survived in Yorkshire into the thirteenth century at least: c.1246 <i>Thomas Drepedewyl</i>, Thornton Bridge; that is ‘kill devil’ (YRS12/267). If there is a connection, the inference may be that the noun ‘drape’ was a back formation from the verb.",,SS116/25,,1418,Welwick,SS130/88,,1458-9,Malham,YRS103/174,,1502,Fishergate,YRS152/107,,1559,Swaledale,LRS1/77,,1628,Pudsey,YRS47/109,,1657,Hambleton,YRS47/75,,1666,Brayton,DW76,,1642,Elmswell,DW119,,nd,Elmswell,YRS12/267,,c.1246,Thornton Bridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1602, a mason called Thomas Wallimsley was to <i>gett, work, dresse and make ready all the stones</i> for building Apperley Bridge.  In this case ‘dressing’ was probably the final squaring and facing of the stone (BAS6/141). The first accounts of the Cutlers’ Company record a payment in 1625 of 2s 6d to George Simonett <i>for dressing of kniues</i> (HCC30). In relation to a cutler’s products it often meant ‘make ready for sale’, ensuring that the necessary finishing processes had been completed: in 1709, the inventory of Joseph Webster listed <i>wares gott up mercantably</i> and a certain amount of <i>undrest ware</i> which needed attention before it could be sold (IH). Joseph Leech was a substantial scissorsmith, and when he died in 1717 he had <i>Sizers</i> [scissors] <i>dressed and undressed, £4 6s 0d</i> (IH).

eavesdropper,,,,,,,The eavesdropper was once the scourge of the local community – a person who lurked at night under the eaves of a neighbour’s house in the hope of gathering titbits of gossip that could then be turned to advantage.,"The serious nature of the misdemeanour is clear from definitions in Law dictionaries, one of which describes the eavesdropper as a person who ‘hearkens after discourse … to frame slanders and mischievous tales’. There is no record of just when eavesdropping started to be considered as an offence but in 1377 Matilda Seamster of Methley was indicted at the manor court for listening under the walls of her neighbours’ houses at night and ‘narrating idle speeches’ (Th35/152). That entry was in Latin, so the word ‘eavesdropper’ was not used, but in Nottingham, in 1487, a jury found that Henry Rowley was a man who wandered around the village during the hours of darkness, and they indicted him as <i>a common evys-dropper</i> (OED). In Yorkshire, the offender was more commonly called an <i>eavesing dropper</i> or an <i>easing dropper</i> and early examples include: 1533 <i>That none esyng droppers watch men howssez</i>, Selby (SS85/34); 1577 <i>Elizabeth Banke ... to kepe hir house in the neight season and not be an esinge droper</i> (YRS131/60) in Rastrick, in 1664, Elizabeth Dyson was presented for <i>standeing under the Ewse of the house of Joseph Goodheire as an Ewseing dropper</i> and was fined 10 shillings (WCR5/142). </br> It is not difficult to see how the word had acquired its meaning. In Old English the noun ‘eavesdrop’ [yfesdrype] referred originally to the water that dripped, or dropped, from the eaves of a house, but from that it came to mean the edge of the roof itself. In 1338, the sale of a house in York, in the narrow lane called St Peter the Little, required the parties concerned to agree about the space they would need should repairs or rebuilding be necessary. Two English words that were included for greater clarity were <i>gettes</i> and <i>efsdropes</i>, that is to say the ‘jetties’ or overhanging upper storeys and the eavesdrops or projecting parts of the roofs (YRS111/182). Clearly, these both affected the space available between the buildings at ground level and this could be a problem in streets like the Shambles in York. As a consequence it became customary to restrict a person from building right up to the edge of his land, lest the water dripping from his eaves should cause a problem. That custom appears to be implicit in a Kent charter dated 868 where the word <i>yfæs drypæ</i> is on record for the first time (OED). It was in the space between the house wall and the ‘eavesdrip’ that our more inquisitive ancestors found shelter and were privy to a neighbour’s secrets. The Old English word <i>efes</i> was actually singular but the final –s has been mistaken for a plural and that is how we use it now. In quite a different usage the word is found in Ribblesdale, in place-names such as Bashall Eaves and Waddington Eaves, and the ‘edge’ here might be the boundary of an early forest.

In 1662, for example, any cutler who <i>made and exposed to sale knives, etc not putting steel into the edges</i> was to be fined 40 shillings (HCC10). That did not deter some dishonest cutlers and a further by-law in 1780 stressed that blades should not be made of ‘cast or pig-iron’: these were compared adversely with <i>knives and forks of steel properly forged or hammered or tempered of the best edge</i> (HCC13). The Act of 1548 <i>against false forging referred to edged tools, weapons and other necessary things having edges</i> but the term was actually in use from the middle of the fourteenth century (OED).

eel-ark,,,,,,,,"Eel Ark Hill is a rare and unexplained place-name in Eshton in the Yorkshire Dales (PNWR6/47) and the explanation of its meaning focuses attention on a deed of 1562 which confirmed a division of lands in Steeton near Tadcaster (YRS50/128). These included ‘the great stang ... and all the pools, ponds, and waters there running from the <i>Eele ark</i> unto Bolton lordship’. The editor explained <i>Eele ark</i> as an enclosure for catching fish, a meaning confirmed in the OED with an example of the word noted in Scotland in 1883. Earlier Latin references are proof the word’s much longer history in west Yorkshire. In 1260, for instance, Furness Abbey acquired fishing rights in Eshton Tarn, and the fishermen who worked for the monks were granted a number of rights: these included half of all the eels taken in an ark fixed in the stream which flowed out of the lake (<i>in archa que stat in rivulo exeunte de predicto lacu</i>). This liberty was then extended to all the arks the abbey might install, to the construction of a building (<i>domus</i>) 'over' the arks, and to the rights of way for abbey servants through the Eshtons' lands (Furn2/464). A similar grant was noted by Whitaker: 1435-6 <i>Pro arcis anguillarum de Alanwath Tarne</i>, Skipton (Whit2/362).  No doubt the hill owes its name to an eel-ark fixed in Eshton Tarn centuries ago.

Typical early examples include n.d. <i>Ellerkelde</i> (YRS69/44); 1387 <i>Ellirsikgate</i> (YRS50/58) but the most frequent combination is ‘ellercarr’.

end (1) ,,,,,,,A resolution or settlement.,"It was formerly common practice for the parties in a dispute to submit the matter at variance to arbitrators and, should they fail to come to an agreement, to leave the decision to an umpire. The judgement arrived at was sometimes called an ‘end’.

In 1598, four bridges in Bradford were ‘in great decay’, and the Justices had to assess and rate the responsibility of each township <i>upon an estreate</i> and then levy and collect the money (YRS3/73).

evidence,evidences,,,,,,"An ‘evidence’ was an important document, particularly a title deed which proved ownership or entitlement to use, and bundles of such documents were quite often referred to as ‘evidences’.","There are early examples in the Paston Letters (1444-65), the second of which refers to ‘evydens … in a seck … enseylyd’ (OED). More typically, at a manorial court in Farnley Tyas, it was ordered in 1524 ‘that each of the free tenants show his evidences’ (DT/161/1). The range of documents this term might cover is made clear in a Star Chamber case of 1535, when it was claimed that a certain William Acclome had destroyed <i>all the Evydences, charters, letters patentes, obligations, acquyetances, billes of Accompte, Court rolles, grantes of advousions, fees and Annuyteis</i> (YRS45/124). Rather less commonly these could be referred to as ‘writings’. </b>Naturally, landholders sought to protect their important documents since it could be difficult to prove ownership of a property without them. Their vulnerability is exposed in a case brought before the magistrates in 1709, when a witness claimed that his cousin had said <i>Ile carry you a Ladder and sett it to your Mother’s Cloisett window, if you’ll pull out a pain of Glass and sett the writeings on fire</i> (QS1/48/9). In that way, he had been assured, he would be <i>safe for the whole estates</i>. It became normal, therefore, at an early date for a man to place his writings in a safe place, in a bag or box that could be sealed, or in a chest that could be locked, most commonly in an ‘evidence’ chest with multiple locks.

farm  ,farmer,farmhold,,,,,‘Farm’ has the same etymology as ‘firm’ and developed from the medieval Latin word <i>firma </i>as the term for a fixed or ‘firm’ annual rent.,"1528 <i>To M<sup>r</sup> Doctor Kellet for firme of his house</i>, York (SS79/260). A tenancy was therefore ‘let to farm’, as in a lease of 1463 in which Robert Hopton was said to have <i>graunted and lettyn to ferme</i> certain lands in Rowley - the lessee <i>gyvyng therfore yerely xiiijd</i> (YDK4). The quantity of land held in this way was known sometimes as a ‘farmhold’: John Smith of Pannal was owed money in 1511 for the <i>farmehold remaining in the hands of the heirs of Thomas Smythe</i>, his son (SS104/3). ‘Farmald’ and ‘farmold’ are typical early spellings of this word. <b> The verb ‘to farm’ was also associated with the practice of paying a fixed sum for the right to take the profits or fees arising from an office or institution: in this way a corn mill, a rectory, or even a common bakehouse could be said to be ‘farmed’. Early examples of the occupational term had these meanings: 1379 Edward Cook, <i>Farmour de Maner</i>, Wakefield (PTWR). In a lease of 1509, William Thorpe of Muskham referred to his lessee John Wood as <i>my farmer</i> (G-A) and in 1607, Sir Richard Tempest, a powerful local gentleman, was described as the <i>farmer of the rectory of Bradford</i> (MD43). </br> Eventually, by a departure from these original senses, a ‘farm’ came to be the estate held by such a rent, rather than the rent itself, and the man who held the estate was its ‘farmer’. The transition in meaning is evident in documents such as the manorial survey of Elmswell (<i>c</i>.1624), where a typical entry reads: <i>Thomas Webster’s Farm - 6 oxgangs with meadow and pasture £12 0s 0d</i> (DW219). <i>The Leeds Mercury</i> of 2 May 1727 carried an advertisement for <i>a Farm … between Berwick and Kiddall </i>but added<i> Note there’s no House on the Farm as yet </i>(Th22/215). By then however the words were starting to be used in their modern sense: 1741 <i>To be Lett. The Farm commonly call’d Lister’s Farm … consisting of a Messuage, Barn, Stable, Outhouses and 130 Acres</i>, Leeds (Th26/93). ‘Farmer’ finally replaced terms such as ‘yeoman’ and ‘husbandman’.

feehouse ,,,,,,,A building where cattle were housed.,"1395 <i>Expensæ circa Fehows</i>, Whitby (SS72/618). The possible meanings of this word were discussed by Canon Atkinson in a lengthy footnote and he appeared to favour the meaning ‘treasury’. He noted also that the word gave rise to a by-name, and that point was taken up later by William Brown, the editor of the <i>Guisbrough Chartulary</i>. Two examples that he quoted were an undated reference to <i>Robert de Fehus</i>, probably from the thirteenth century, and 1321 <i>William del Fehous</i>, Lofthouse: in 1468 a tenement in Hawnby had both a <i>fehous</i> and a <i>helmehous</i>. Brown considered these to be references to cow-houses (SS89/164n). The same word occurred in Mirfield in 1463 (DD/SR/213/24) and several times in the records of Fountains Abbey, where the meaning is explicit: 1537 <i>Robert Brown shall kepe yerely at the said Dare-house, loige and feahowse callyd Burthwaytt … two bulles, thre score kye and twentye and vij of their folowers</i>, Bouthwaite (SS42/277).

feeman,feemaster,,,,,,,"In the OED the word ‘feeman’ is said to mean ‘a vassal’, and that may be a possible explanation in the single example quoted. However, these words were used repeatedly in connection with important monasteries where they clearly refer to the keeping of ‘cattle’. The feeman was responsible for the running of the ‘feehouse’, but came under the authority of the ‘feemaster’ who was in charge of all the feehouses. ‘Feeman’ was active into the seventeenth century at least: 1512 <i>servauntes, loigers ande feamen</i>, Bouthwaite (YRS140/196); 1567 <i>The femans chamber</i>, Well (SS26/209); 1615 <i>hyered to come as a husbandman or fee man</i>, Brandsby (NYRO44/104). Feemaster was also a frequent term: in 1508, the tenants of Morker Grange had their lease on the understanding that they keep all the cattle sent to them by the abbey, making <i>yerely trewe accompte and trewly make awnser and delyveraunce of all the styrkes that shall cume of the seide kye yerely to the feamayster at the burnynge tyme</i> (YRS140/232). The terms were in use in other monasteries: in 1533 <i>Richard Aluerton, femast</i>[er] at Rievaulx gave evidence in a Starchamber case (YRS41/50) and Black quoted several Scottish examples in his account of the surname Femister.

It was more commonly used in reference to making a binding contract or agreement, as with tradesmen: 1579 <i>I have fest by greatt with Richard Longlay … two hunderth yeardes of hatchlar </i>[ashlar], Woodsome (KayeCP); 1661 <i>spent goeing about to fest this worke on workmen and myselfe 5s</i>, Elland (PR); 1698 <i>we have fest a house building for him which is to be seven yards long and four and a half wide</i>; 1722 <i>proposalls are to be made of festing the said Ryding bridges</i>, West Riding (QS1).

fey,feigh,,,,,,"To clean, the usual spelling in Yorkshire of 'to fay'. The OED has examples of the same word from <i>c</i>.1205 to 1400, spelt ‘fay’, meaning especially to clean weapons.","There is then a gap from 1400 to 1573 when Tusser employed the word in his book on good husbandry. New references from Yorkshire add to our understanding of how ‘to fay’ had developed the sense of to ‘clear away’ by the sixteenth century: 1530 <i>For feyng the howse</i>, Burton Pidsea (SS35/135): in 1533, a Wakefield tenant was ordered at the borough court to <i>fey hys donge hyll a way</i>, so that it would not interfere with the town sewer or skytterick (YRS74/17). Something of the same idea is contained in the accounts of a Sheffield iron forge, in 1574, where a workman was paid <i>for breakeinge and feyinge of synders </i>(HS2). At St Michael’s, Spurriergate, in York, in 1539, two labourers worked on repairs to John Robinson’s house and received 2s from the churchwardens <i>for feyng of the ground wall that was falyn down </i>(CCW213). They were preparing the site for new foundations. A lease of 1578 allowed Thomas Lockwood of Thurstonland to clear the land that he was about to occupy, specifically <i>to feye and stubbe up … all maner of woddes</i> (YDK76-7). <br>The meaning extended to the cleansing of ponds and streams, either simply because they had to be kept flowing smoothly or to scour out the accumulated mud for use on the land. In 1570, each Halifax householder was ordered to <i>feye the watercourse … against his own house</i> (HAS37). Hunter’s <i>Hallamshire Glossary</i> (1829) gives the meaning ‘to empty, as a pond, of mud’. The spelling he used was ‘feigh’, which I have found in coal-mining accounts: 1717 <i>Titus, one day to feigh</i>, Farnley (MS11); 1750 <i>to feigh and repair the level</i>, Elsecar (HS2). This was doubtless by analogy with 'weigh' and it represents the west Yorkshire pronunciation. </br>A more specific meaning was ‘to winnow’: in 1642 Henry Best of Elmswell wrote of oats being <i>threshed and feyed</i> (DW6), and a reference in 1535 in Stillingfleet to <i>ij feing clothes</i> (YRS45/127) indicates that this was not a recent development. Feying cloths were winnowing cloths, and they feature frequently in the inventories of farmers. In Holmfirth, there are occasional references to ‘feying rakes’, e.g. 1742 <i>cow rake</i> [cowl?], <i>feaing rake</i> (G-A). </br> The word remained in common use through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and even into the modern period. It is met with in commonplace books, diaries and, particularly, in coal-mining and farming records. In Tong, William Barker was paid for <i>feying the draw end</i> of the colliery in 1760 (Mss4c/5) and in 1815 a South Crosland farmer wrote of the time he spent <i>feying for the Coal hole</i> of his new house. In 1819 he was <i>faying down hills</i> as he levelled land newly enclosed from the moor (GRD).

field ,,,,,,,,"This is a word with a complicated semantic history, with meanings which can overlap chronologically, reflecting differences in land organisation from one village to another. In its earliest phase it was used of a tract of open country, contrasted with ‘wood’ and ‘fen’, and it is that meaning which explains major place-names such as Mirfield, Sheffield and Wakefield. As settlements became established, a new functional meaning developed, and for a long period during the transition from Old English to Middle English ‘field’ came to describe unenclosed land which was worked communally. Typically in those years each township had an area of arable which would be called the town fields. An undated thirteenth-century deed for Lepton records the grant <i>de tribus acris terre in campis de Lepton</i>; that is three acres in the fields of Lepton (WBD/4/6). In fact the sections of these fields had their own names which differed from one community to another: those in Lepton included North Field, Broomfield and South Field. Such fields had no permanent enclosures, but temporary fences would be erected to allow for their seasonal management. Those town fields no longer exist but their locations can be found on old maps, and their names have sometimes survived: Southfield Road in Almondbury has replaced Southfield Lane which owed its name to the town’s original South Field. </br> We now use the word ‘field’ for an area of ground enclosed by some type of fence and given over to pasture, or crops such as corn, turnips or potatoes. Documents can reflect those transitional stages in the word’s meaning: 1563-4 <i>Rawdenfild afore this suit begane for this xxx or xl yeres continually haith bene and yet is a severall inclosid ground having no usiall throughe passage nor hieght way in it nor through it</i> (YRS114/105); 1722 <i>Samuel Wright was mowing oats in a close or field not far from Bilbrough</i> (QS1/61/9).

filemaker ,filesmith,,,,,,These terms cannot readily be distinguished from that of ‘file-cutter’ and the evidence for all three is relatively late.,"Of course files will have been in constant use in the cutlery trade from the outset, but it is likely that cutlers originally made their own. In 1616, for example, an Eckington cutler called Roger Barber had in his possession <i>4 fyles with some other small tool</i>s (FBH118). The occupational terms which indicate that file-cutting had developed as a separate craft date from the mid-seventeenth century: 1657 <i>Jonas Tayler of Sheffeld filemaker</i> (PR3/206): 1675 <i>George Chow of Sheffield fylemaker</i> (TWH16/191). It was not until 1682 though that these workers were brought under the jurisdiction of the Cutlers Company (FBH118). Examples of ‘filesmith’ are recorded later than those for ‘filemaker’ although the two words seem to have had the same meaning: 1698 <i>Anna fil’ Joh’is Hellifield filesmith de Sheffield</i> (PR4/168).

fire engine ,,,,,,,,"Engines have been used to extinguish fires by projecting water at them from at least the seventeenth century, and they have become increasingly efficient over the years. However, in a mining context the earliest fire engines were pumps, designed to draw water from a pit and keep it dry. These were apparently in use from the late 1600s, and in 1693 payment was made to a Colsterdale man for boring a pump 5 yards long and <i>throwing a Rag Wheel and bringing them to the coal pit </i>(BM82/41).  There is mention in <i>The Compleat Collier</i> (1708) of an ‘Invention of Drawing Water by Fire’ which colliers in that area were wary of, considering it an extra hazard where so much ‘Sulpherous Matter’ was already present (CC21).  The cartographer John Warburton was in the Leeds area in 1719 and made his way from Kiddal to Austhorpe: he says in his journal that he crossed<i> a moor with cole pits on it</i> before arriving at the seat of Nicholas Moor, esq. who had <i>a good coliary adjoining, and a fire engine which I saw working</i> (YAJ15/76). Engines of this kind were not uncommon in parts of the West Riding through the eighteenth century: 1742 <i>a Fire Engine … which will draw at present all the Water</i>, Hunslet (CKY8); 1787 <i>shall erect and build one or more Fire Engines for the purpose of drawing out the water</i>, Beeston (DB129/1). </br>One of the most explicit references is in a Beeston document drawn up in 1769 which drew attention to the actions of a certain Mr Wilks who <i>in the lifetime of Mr Denison, but without his consent, began to build a Fire Engine upon the Wasts of the said manor … which he has covered in and is also erecting another building adjoining to the same in which a Boiler belonging to the said Fire Engine is to be placed </i>(DB129/1).

fire-point,fire-pote,,,,,,"A pointed iron bar, which served to 'poke' or agitate the coals in a fire. ","In 1676-7 Francis Nettleton attacked John Crosley of Tong <i>with a hote firepoint</i> (QS1).  An amusing but confused use of the word was quoted by an Almondbury minister, the Rev. Alfred Easther. Writing about the noted local character Joe o’ Nuppits, he related how Joe had made his way to Padiham, in Lancashire, begging along the way. He fared badly and found the journey more than he had bargained for: on his return he complained that he had <i>stopp’d at Padiham sooa long</i> that his legs had <i>swelled as thick as firepoints</i> (EAH46). </br>The Halifax historian John Watson included ‘fire-point’ in his glossary of local words in 1775 with the explanation that it was ‘so called perhaps from its having a sharp end’. In one sense that was true, but the explanation masks the fact that ‘fire-point’ was itself a popular form of the even earlier ‘fire-pote’. The vowel in ‘pote’ was made into a diphthong by dialect speakers, which resulted in an almost inevitable confusion with ‘point’. To ‘pote’ or ‘poit’ had a variety of related meanings but was still commonly used to describe the action of agitating or moving about with a stick or some other implement. The ‘fire-pote’ was simply a fire poker. </br> This spelling is recorded in Yorkshire documents from the sixteenth century. When Richard Thewlis of Dalton died, in 1588, he had <i>one fire pote</i> listed among his possessions by the appraisers (WBW/19) and in 1644 Gamaliel Bingley of Lepton had <i>two iron ranges brigges two fier poits and two payre of Tongues</i> (HMC/180). Occasionally an abbreviated form occurred: 1622 <i>one iron range, bridgs, poyt, tonges, rackes and spites</i>, Cottingley (LRS1/62). </br> Other local documents show that the ‘fire pote’ could also be a formidable weapon. In a witchcraft case of 1652 a Huddersfield woman called Hester France was brought to trial at York, and in evidence one of her detractors recalled how she had one day been <i>mending the fire with the fire poite</i> when Hester France burst into her house, looked at the implement in her hand and threatened <i>to seare her lipps with itt</i> (SS40/51). Other women went beyond mere threats: in 1720, John Lightowlers tried to arrest Joseph Maud but the prisoner’s wife Mary <i>run after him with an iron fire pote and struck him over his back and arms … thrust at him and made a hole in his coat and afterwards, when he had taken the fire pote from her, burst his nose with her fist till blood gushed out</i>, Northowram (QS1/59/6). It was of course an implement always ready to hand and there can be no doubt that it played its part in many an ale-house argument.

They were regularly used as temporary gates and fences: 1678 <i>We lay in payne that James Greeneald sett two stoopes … at the top stile … and do keepe theire a yate or fleicke duringe the time that the corne is leading out of the upper field</i>, Kirkheaton (WBR/11); 1684 <i>making of gates and fleakes</i>, Tong (Mss3/372). Such hurdles were evidently of a regular size, for the word was sometimes used as a measure: 1640 <i>one halfe land, beinge more than halfe a fleake brode … in the Kyrkefeilde</i>, Ouseburn (MD38). It is not uncommon therefore as an element in minor place-names: 1585 <i>Leafleake</i>, Idle (PNWR3/234); 1623 <i>Christopher Sike close called Fleikcliffe</i>, Lepton (WBM). The same word was used of shelves and racks, and the inference may be that not all these had solid frames: 1570 <i>One paire of wayne fleycks price xxd</i>, Hutton Conyers (SS26/229); 1656 <i>for unjustly taking away a pair of wayne fleaks</i>, Thornton Bridge (NRQS5/234); 1689 <i>2 Shelves and a bread fleake</i>, Barnoldswick (YRS118/72).

fleak bridge,,,,,,,,"Fleak Bridge is not uncommon as a minor place-name, so it is likely that wattled hurdles or wooden frames with bars were used in 'bridge' construction. In fact, the OED has a reference to a bridge made with 'flekes' in <i>c.</i>1330. Yorkshire references to the place-name include: <i>c.</i>1250 <i>inter Flekebridge et Northolme</i>, Cononley (YRS160/166); 1365 'from <i>Flekbrig</i> to the end of the town', Thorner (Th15/170); 1606 <i>Fleake Brdige ... in bad repair</i>, Bedale (NRQS1/56). An unidentified <i>Flekebrigge</i> of the thirteenth century is listed by Smith (PNWR7/187). It is uncertain how best to interpret what may have originally been a generic rather than a specific name. A Pickering castle document of 1325-6 shows that hurdles were sometimes laid on bridges to protect the surface from the wheels of carts - <i>pro eisdem salvandis pro rotis carectarum</i;> (NRR4/223). In Malton, in 1589, <i>fleakes and wood (were) laid over the water for passengers, for the time that the bridge was in repainring</i> (NRQS3/24). This practice is a reminder that a 'bridge' might be a causeway across marsh land, in which case a 'fleak brigg' may have been such a structure.

fleet  ,,,,,,,,"This is a frequent suffix in Yorkshire place-names, particularly popular along the Ouse, with Yokefleet in the East Riding and Adlingfleet, Ousefleet and Swinefleet in the West Riding. Hunslet is a less transparent example, although early spellings include <i>Hunsflete</i>. The meaning in such cases has to do with channels or courses of water but the great changes in the river network over the last one thousand years have obscured the history of many such fleets. Early references include: 1189-99 <i>de vno tofto prope domum suam, scilicet super fletam</i>, Howden (YAJ11/187); 1274-5 ‘obstructed the course of the water of <i>Flet</i>’, Snaith (YRS151/88); 1403 ‘from … Baxtergate towards the west to <i>la flete</i> of Hedon’ (YRS69/59): later in the document just quoted is a reference to ‘the sewer <i>del flete</i>’.  It remained an active word in the local vocabulary: 1637 <i>unto Tollerton and so unto the fleet where a bridge ought to be built</i> (NRQS4/72). As a minor place-name element it is also very common and this relates the word to particular localities. In 1352, a grant of arable land in the fields of Drax included <i>one selion called Fletstang</i> (YRS76/65), possibly associated with the <i>Fleetlands</i> named in the township’s 1840 tithe award (PNWR4/10). Some of these fleets were water channels which served as drains in the open-field system. In Masbrough, for example, three selions were said in 1347 to lie ‘scattered in the fields … between the<i> Fletes</i>’ (YRS102/86) and one other selion abutted ‘at one end on one<i> Flete </i>and at the other on the second<i> Flete</i>’ (YRS111/142). These aspects of the word’s history are associated mostly with low-lying areas and are reasonably well documented, unlike examples noted in upland regions: 1579 <i>ther ys 1000 acres and more of Fleet, Mosses and Cragg which ys or maie bee convenient for the Game</i>. This survey was concerned with Langstrothdale, and a statement by the jurors of the manor court reveals more about the nature of the landscape: <i>Wee finde that the Fleets and Mosses are nott to be estymatyd by Acre Tayle with a saife conscience, bothe for wyllde Hidde </i>[heath]<i> and closs Lynge</i> (Whit2/492). These were bleak, wet moors with bogs and occasional tarns, but precisely what ‘fleet’ referred to in an upland region is not clear.

float (1),float gap,float-gate,,,,,,"These words have been noted in the West Riding: 1465 <i>juxta le floytyate</i>, Rowley (YDK52); 1482 <i>le common floyt</i>, Rowley (MD335); 1610 <i>for not keeping Braygill float gapp fenced</i>, Airton (DDMa). The associations in these cases are all with the control of water so they may be early examples of ‘float’ in the sense explained by Marshall: 1785 ‘The floats are trenches, receiving by the means of floodgates … the waters of a river, brook or rivulet, and conveying it along the upper margin, and upon the tops of the … swells of the field of improvement’ (OED). The floating of riverside meadows is a well-documented practice, and research by Mary Higham has shown that similar methods were employed to create retting pools in the production of linen. She identified early retting pool systems in several riverside townships, notably in Newton in Bowland (MHW129), and that makes the following by-name or surname of interest: 1310 <i>Thomas le Floyter</i>, Appletreewick (YRS154/277); 1379 <i>Henricus Floyter</i>, Newton in Bowland (PTWR); 1415 <i>Roger Floyter alias Bowland</i>, York (SS96/124).

fold  ,,,,,,,"A fold was a pen or enclosure for animals, and the inference is that it must often have been a temporary structure, made by fastening hurdles, bars or ‘fleaks’ to fixed stakes.","In his <i>Farming Book</i> (1642) Henry Best devoted a whole section to the <i>foldinge of sheepe</i> and wrote in detail about how the folds were constructed, noting which wood was best for the <i>folde barres</i>, and how the bars should be put together. It was a practice usually carried out during the growing period, for that meant that the grazing might be controlled and stock moved from one locality to another. It also meant that areas of ground could be progressively manured: 1557 <i>when it was faughe they did fold ther shepe ther to make the grounde fartill,</i> Bulmer (YRS114/90). Henry Best recommended setting the folds on land where it was intended to sow rye or ‘massledine’ the following year, and such a piece of land was said to be <i>fold-mucked</i> (DW16-9,104). </br> There are frequent references to the practice in medieval documents, and the following agreement formed part of an undated grant to Rievaulx Abbey: ‘The grantor to find and repair a sufficient sheepfold in <i>Stainburg</i> for the monks, and to find sufficient straw in the sheepfold for 200 sheep which were to lie in that sheepfold or the grantor’s fold as the monks’ shepherd should find most convenient. The dung from both places to belong to the grantors’ (YRS39/81). ‘Faldingworth’ or ‘Follingworth’ are not uncommon minor place-names, especially in the hilly parts of the central Pennines, and since they mean ‘folding enclosure’ this may take the history of the practice back to the Old English period: 1379 <i>Faldyngworth</i>, Norland (PTWR); 1425 <i>Faldingwoth</i>, Rothwell (Th24/303). </br> We are more familiar with the word ‘fold’ in the sense of a small enclosed area near to or adjoining a farm house: 1593 ‘an enclosure (<i>unam chortem</i>) called a <i>yarde or foulde</i>’, Dewsbury (YAJ21/468). In fact there may have been a transitional period in the word’s semantic history for there are references in farming leases which suggest that part of the farmyard may sometimes have continued to be used for ‘folding’. In 1680, for example, the tenant of land at Meltham was allowed <i>so much folding in the south part of the fold there as lyeth south from the south side of the mistall door</i> (G-A). </br> There are alternative words for ‘fold’ in this sense: in south and west Yorkshire, for example, it was also referred to, from 1560 at least, as the <i>fold-stead</i>, and, in parts of east and north Yorkshire, <i>foregarth</i> was an alternative. These terms are dealt with separately but in the latter case it was defined in 1618 as <i>the foregarth or foulde adjoining to the north side of the said messuage. </i>The house had been recently extended or rebuilt and the foregarth divided into four equal parts. One of these parts, along with a <i>moietie of the ... barn or lath</i> was leased with the west half of the house and there was to be <i>free roome within the garth … for the theaking and repairing of the lath</i>. The residue was <i>to lye in common for the useage, reparacion and uphoulding of the whole messuage or firehouse </i>(MD217). </br> A third meaning of ‘fold’ is the one defined in Easther’s glossary as ‘a collection of cottages, standing in a yard more or less inclosed’. The OED notes this meaning in Lancashire, from 1863, but there is much more to its history. The street directories of the early nineteenth century show that it was by then already an established generic. In Halifax, in 1837, there were town centre localities named Aked’s Fold, Pickles Fold, and Senior’s Fold; in Huddersfield there was Chadwick’s Fold, and in Sheffield Barratt’s Fold. In the town centres these folds came to be associated with cramped living conditions and even squalor. In the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of 1849 it was reported that <i>the courts and culs de sacs … locally termed foulds</i>, were often inhabited by the very poor and were <i>reeking with stench and the worst sort of abomination</i> (YTD16). </br> Many such folds have been swept away in slum clearance schemes and few of the town centre names appear to have survived. However, it is quite a different story in some textile villages. In Honley, for example, a township near Almondbury, there are at present Brooke Fold, Jessop Fold, Swift’s Fold and France Fold, all with a local surname as the first element, and Doctor Fold, where a dynasty of village medical men lived out their lives. The folds in such cases were often associated with one family, and the inference is that the number of cottages increased as the families expanded. A manorial survey of Huddersfield, in 1716, seems to catch the word fold at a transitional stage of its development, for it gives the rent paid by John Horsfall for <i>six cottages all within the compass of his Folds</i> (DD/RE). </br> And yet this last use of the word may have a much longer history, particularly in the Calder Valley. In 1654, for example, an entry in the Heptonstall parish register records the baptism of John, son of Richard Hudson <i>of Hudsonfold</i>: other early examples include: 1658 <i>Wilson Fould</i> and 1709 </i>Hopkinson Fold</i>, both in Halifax (MD149). In Almondbury <i>Gibson Fold</i> is recorded in 1688 and <i>Megson Fold</i> in 1699-1702 (PR). In the latter case the Megsons appear to have left the village of Newsome <i>c.</i>1688 and the families said to be of Megson Fold were called Sykes and Brook. It seems that some of these place-names could survive the departure of the families after whom they were named, at least temporarily.",foldage; folding; fold-stead; ladder room; smithy,YRS114/90,,1557,Bulmer,"DW16-9, 104",,1642,Elmswell,YRS39/81,,nd,Rievaulx Abbey,PTWR,,1379,Norland,Th24/303,,1425,Rothwell,G-A,,1680,Meltham,MD217,,1618,np,YTD16,,1849,Huddersfield,DD/RE,,1716,Huddersfield,MD149,,1709,Halifax,PR,,1688,Almondbury,PR,,1699-1702,Almondbury,,,,PR,1654,Heptonstall,,MD149,1658,Halifax,PR,1688,Almondbury,PR,1699-1702,Almondbury,,,,

Similar examples include: 1361 <i>Et de redditibus liberorum natiuorum Cotariorum cum forland per annum</i>, Leeds (Th45/108); 1382 ‘tenement, 2½ bovates of land and 6 acres of <i>Forland</i>’, Yeadon (SW74); 1385 a messuage, 5 bovates of land and ‘six acres of <i>forland</i>’, Dodworth (YRS39/64); 1443-4 ‘two acres called <i>Forland</i> at <i>Staynrawes</i>’, Stockeld (YRS76/151). The land thus referred to might be arable or meadow but as it had come into use after the field system was established, it may be that ‘fore’ described a location beyond or in front of those fields. It is a complicated topic but has been discussed by several landscape specialists, notably by Stephen Moorhouse (WYAS668-9). The word can be compared with forbyland, fordole and foreshut and contrasted with rodeland, which are all commented on separately.",,YRS12/62,,1258,Barwick in Elmet,YRS120/53,,nd,Draughton,Th45/108,,1361,Leeds,SW74,,1382,Yeadon,YRS39/64,,1385,Dodworth,YRS76/151,,1443-4,Stockeld,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
foreman ,,,,,,,,"The OED offers four related meanings for this word, with examples from <i>c</i>.1425. It was frequent though as a by-name and Reaney has north-country references from the fourteenth century, with the suggestion that it meant ‘swineherd’. However, in the accounts of Bolton Priory the evidence points to the foreman there as the principal workman responsible for oxen, which suggests a meaning more akin to ‘foreman’ in its modern sense: 1295-6 <i>Stipendia bovariorum … in stipendio unius forman pro eodem termino iijs</i>; 1318-9 <i>De terra Ade le Forman in Halton ijs</i> (YRS154). In 1530, <i>John Forman</i> was the master mason responsible for York Minster and he had fourteen other masons working under him. Occupational names of this kind could still be fluid at that time so he may actually have been the ‘foreman’. In a Wakefield will of 1550-1 two bequests were made, the first to Henry Butfold, a shopkeeper, and the second to his servant <i>beyng foreman in his shoppe</i>, possibly a ‘front’ man, capable of acting on his master’s behalf, or more literally in charge of the shop front (Th19/262).

forestall  ,forestaller,,,,,,"As a word meaning to waylay, or take up a position in order to ambush somebody."," The history of ‘forestall’ can be traced back over one thousand years. In those earliest examples the element ‘stall’ simply meant place or position. Later, it was produce that was ‘ambushed’ or intercepted, on its way to the public markets, and to ‘forestall’ came to signify the buying up of goods before they reached the market. An Act in 1353 made this practice illegal and its repercussions are evident in courts of various kinds throughout the following centuries: 1408 <i>Excepto quod, si aliquis legitimo modo per xij juratos fuerit convictus forstallarius,</i> Beverley (BTD9). In 1485, the poulterers in York were ordered to <i>sell there pulan in noo place but in the common market called Thursday market and not in noo housses … and goo not from bar to bar to forstall any vitall that cometh to the market</i> (YRS98/113). In 1589, a baker named William Fell was indicted for <i>buyeng … malt, and selling the same agane contrary to the statute maid against forstallers and ingrossers</i>, York (YRS138/93). In view of the word’s earliest history, the ‘stall’ is unlikely to have had anything to do with stalls in the market, at least directly, but our ancestors may have made such a connection.",,BTD9,,1408,Beverley,YRS98/113,,1485,York,YRS138/93,,1589,York,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

fornent,fornenst,,,,,,"A combination of ‘fore’ and ‘anent’, meaning opposite to, against or facing.","In 1537, the town brook of Eccleshill was described as <i>running fore anent Calverley lane end, by the hedge side</i> (DBB5/8/176). This is very close to the form of the word listed in Wright, where ‘forenent’ is said to have been in general dialect use in Scotland and Ireland but restricted in England to the northern counties. Early spelling developments involved the introduction of a letter ‘s’ which created the combination ‘nst’ and was responsible for several almost eccentric spellings. Many of these references are in Yorkshire wills of the Tudor period, identifying particular parts of the churchyard: for example in 1505 one Leeds testator asked to be buried <i>negh to the diall or els fornenst the Palmcrosse </i>(Th4/10) whereas in 1557 Edmund Parker of Rothwell preferred a site <i>foranempste the saide churche porche </i>(Th27/109).

The words he used to ‘break the spell’ were <i>God and sancta charytie blysse the beast</i> (PTD199). A much later reference is undated but likely to be <i>c.</i>1840 at the latest.

However, the word must have been current over a much wider area, for I find it regularly in different parts of Yorkshire from Elizabeth’s reign. In 1597 it is found in the typical context <i>galdes, taxes and layes</i>’ (MD247), but sometimes the tax is specified, as in <i>the king’s gaudes</i> in 1638 (YAJ5/391) and <i>constable gauldes</i> and <i>bridge galds</i> in 1674 (QS1/13). In 1695, Richard Wigglesworth of Conistone recorded payment <i>For a bridge gawld ... at Skipton</i> (RW47).

gall (1) ,,,,,,,,"The word ‘geology’ has a Greek origin but it had entered English via medieval Latin in the fourteenth century, with a meaning far removed from our modern understanding of the word. Geology as a science, concerned with the earth’s crust and the underlying strata, dates back only to the late 1700s, and much of the vocabulary that we associate with the subject has developed since then: the word ‘fault’ for instance, as used by geologists, is on record only from 1796 (OED). The vocabulary of miners is therefore of great interest, for they had been encountering and naming rock strata features for centuries. Their use of ‘gall’ to describe a fault or an intrusion goes back to the 1600s at least. A bill of complaint that was filed in Chancery in 1659 had to do with events in the Halifax area earlier in the century and, when the matter came to trial, one witness testified that they <i>had sunk a new pit and met with a mare or gall … which hindered them from getting the coal</i>, Shibden (HAS30/136). ‘Gall’ in this sense is listed in the OED but only from 1805 and only in Scotland. It was possibly the most common of several words given to such features, and later examples indicate that it was usually what geologists call an intrusion, that is an influx of rock or extraneous matter into the stratum of coal: 1691 <i>working thorrow a gall</i>, Farnley (MS11); 1754 <i>for going through a gall 1s</i>, Beeston (DB129/4); 1812 <i>Breaking down at galls in the bord 8s 0d</i>, Soil Hill (HAS32/280).",dike; horse; mare,HAS30/136,,1659,Halifax,MS11,,1691,Farnley,DB129/4,,1754,Beeston,HAS32/280,,1812,Soil Hill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gamekeeper ,,,,,,,,"Dictionaries define the gamekeeper as a person employed on a large estate whose job it is to take care of the wild animals and prevent poaching. This definitions concentrates on the nineteenth-century meaning of the word and emphasises the professional gamekeeper’s skill in woodcraft. However, the original meaning of gamekeeper may be rather different. In a sense the office has been in existence from at least the Middle Ages, when parkers and warreners protected or kept the animals on the lord’s estate, but the word itself passed into common usage only after 1671, when the Game Act came into force and made hunting the exclusive privilege of the landed gentry (Munsche16). The first OED reference to gamekeeper is from that Act, but the word had apparently been used before then on the king’s estates, and Royal gamekeepers had long had the right to prevent people of ‘meane qualitie’ from taking the king’s game. These Royal gamekeepers were themselves privileged members of the upper classes. The passing of the Act was really a triumph by the country gentry, not only over the king but also over all those with non-landed wealth. From 1671, lords of manors were authorised to employ one or more gamekeepers, and these men had the right to take and seize the guns, nets and other hunting ‘engines’ of unqualified persons, however wealthy they might be. In real terms sporting privilege had been transferred from the king to the landed gentry, and so had the preservation of the game. Not surprisingly, in such a tight-knit social group, there was a tendency to appoint gamekeepers from within their own ranks. In 1733, for example, Dame Anne Kaye of Woodsome Hall <i>appointed Sir John Lister Kaye of Denby Grange her gamekeeper</i> (QS4); in 1738, the Rev. Mr Philip Kitchon was <i>appointed gamekeeper to Thomas Bright and Mrs Mary Lowther, for the Mannors of Marton, Tolthorpe and Nunthorp</i> (NRQS8/224). These were hardly gamekeepers as we now understand the word but persons of considerable social status, and their office gave them the authority to confiscate weapons and enforce the property qualifications of the Game Acts. In 1671, these were set at £100 a year for freeholders and £150 for leaseholders, amounts well above the electoral franchise. Almost certainly from a humbler background was Elias Hollingworth, gamekeeper to the Duke of Leeds. His tombstone is sited outside the south porch of Kirkburton church and it records his death in 1709 aged 36, with a moving tribute: <i>One humble, meek and patient here doth lie Who hunting Lov’d and feared not to Dye.</i>",,QS4,,1733,Woodsome Hall,NQRS8/224,,1738,"Marton, Tolthorpe and Nunthorp",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Skipton, John Nicolson was referred to in the period 1682-5 as <i>a Foranner … a Gangerell Fellow</i>: his name suggests that he may have been from Scotland (PR).

A gap could also be an authorised opening, secured with a temporary barrier. When woods were being felled, the access routes for carriages had to be widened and these left gaps in the fences which would be mended later: 1690 <i>for fenceing of gapps to be left for leadeing or carrying away of any wood, barke or charcoale, </i>Tong; 1795-6<i> William Crosland … for fencing gaps and taking care of woods in Crosland</i> (WBE/1/107). In fact, many ‘gaps’ referred to an opening in a wall or hedge that was part of a right of way and would usually have a name: 1570 <i>the east car gappe is the trewe and auncyent gappe both in my tyme, my father’s and grandfather’s</i>, Abbotside (YRS130/7).

gardener  ,,,,,,,,"In wills of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word ‘gardener’ was used as an alternative to ‘tutor’, a meaning that appears to have gone unnoticed. It may have been widely used, but the evidence at the moment is confined to Yorkshire. It is possible, I suppose, that ‘gardener’ had come to be confused with guardian, because of a similarity in their pronunciation and role: 1545 <i>I will that Christofer Felde, marcar, shall have the guardinaige of George Kaye, myne eldest sone,</i> Wakefield (Th19/151). However, it would not be surprising if the ‘gardener’ was thought of as a person who would ‘cultivate’ and protect a child. In 1574, Nicholas Heslett of Slaidburn referred to George Beesley as <i>gardinar</i> to his child (CS2/15) and, in 1579 John Spenselay of Grinton named three people who he wished to be <i>gardeners and tutors</i> of his children (YRS152/225). In 1588, the will of Robert Mylner of Pudsey left <i>Tuicon of children to wife Mary and when she mariethe then ... they shall chuse suche gardiners as God shall put them in mynd</i> (YRS50/171). In 1592 Robert Hobson of Stainton made his <i>twoe bretheren in lawe</i> ... <i>gardeyners unto</i> his son Robert (YAJ20/14). Another explicit reference is found in the will of Robert Wilson of Selby, in 1656:</br><i>I give to Benjamin Wilson, my sonne, £20, which is in the hands of Thomas Hembrough, Thomas Palmer and Richard Linlay … for his education and bringing of him up … and I desire that Thomas Hembrough wilbe his tutore or gardenar, to take care of him and of his futer good </i>(YRS47/194).",,Th19/151,,1545,Wakefield,CS2/15,,1574,Slaidburn,YRS152/225,,1579,Grinton,YRS50/171,,1588,Pudsey,YAJ20/14,,1592,Stainton,YRS47/194,,1656,Selby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gate (1) ,,,,,,,"In general usage a 'gate' is a form of barrier, a door, set across a gap in a wall or hedge, and it can be opened to allow people and animals to pass from one place to another.","In many early Yorkshire texts it had the spelling ‘yate’ which is dealt with under that headword. It is therefore quite different from the word ‘gate’ which means ‘way’ or ‘road’ and is of Scandinavian origin: 1286 ‘the way called <i>Linlaygate</i>’, Fixby (YRS65/53); 1372 ‘near the lane called <i>Cougate’</i>, Hunmanby (YRS111/105); <i>c</i>.1545 <i>all maner ways, gates and yattes</i>, Thurstonland (G-A); 1558 <i>one way or gate leadynge from the common of Skyrcot</i>, Halifax (YDK99). Celia Fiennes was one of the first to draw attention to the confusion that these two words might cause when she wrote in 1697 that ‘people … in the northern parts … tell you its very good gate, instead of saying it is good way, and they call their gates yates’. It is a familiar word generally in the sense of ‘street’, as in towns such as Leicester, Nottingham and York, but it had the same meaning in smaller places, where the main street was known as the town gate: also a particular right of way within and between villages could be called a cartgate, a kirkgate or a waingate, all terms of great local significance. In coal-mining the word was in frequent use, notably in the common terms boardgate and watergate, although the meaning is not always clear and some underground gates may actually have been doors: 1713 <i>timber which was cut down … for stoops and rails for making coal pitt gates</i>, Shibden (HAS30/143). Compounds of this kind are dealt with separately.</br>In other contexts the word was the equivalent of ‘journey’. In 1573, travelling expenses were paid to Thomas Naylour of Almondbury <i>for two gates that he made to Bradford</i> (KayeCP) and similar entries in township books refer in 1694 to <i>gates to the visitation</i>, Almondbury (D12) or, in 1776, to <i>a gate for Croner to Halifax</i>; that is a journey from Honley to Halifax to see the coroner (HO/CP). In 1746, the Almondbury constable accounted 1s 6d for <i>Jos. Fields gate up and down the township in order to billet the soldiers</i> (D173/1).

gate (2) ,beast grass  ,cattle gate,,,,,"In numerous northern land deeds the word ‘gate’ referred to a right for animals such as cattle, horses, sheep and swine to ‘go’ onto certain grazing lands, it was a right to pasturage.","1474 <i>two horsegatez in the parke … viijth swynegate ... in Northduffeld</i> (YRS69/35): in 1479 the council in York decided that Richard Carbert and his predecessors <i>had from tyme out of mind right to have xx gaits</i> on Knavesmire pasture (YRS98/30). These common pastures were stinted, that is to say they were considered to provide grazing for a fixed number of animals, and it was these divisions that were called ‘gates’: these were not fenced off but great care was taken to see that the pasture was not overloaded. A Bradford deed of 1615 typically refers to <i>fyfteene beastegates, or sufficient common of pasture for the harbage </i>[herbage]<i> of fyfteene beastes</i> (MM/A/238) and in Hetton in 1694 were <i>fower cattle gates or common of pasture and herbage ... for four beastes </i>(MD87). The number of ‘gates’ in a pasture took into account the different types of animals, as well as their ages, but in general the grazing would support many more sheep than cows, and more cows than horses (AW71). Moreover, because the ‘gates’ came to be associated with particular properties, they could be subdivided when the property was shared. In 1739, the Holmfirth tenant who held the moiety or half of the messuage called Greenhouse had a right to <i>four beastgates and a half</i> (G-A). Other compound words of this kind are: 1538 <i>their shepegaytes on Follyfate Ryge</i> (YRS69/68); 1539 <i>habent inter se pasturam pro vjtxx bobus, Anglice Oxegates ibidem</i>, Welburn (SS83/321); 1595 <i>fower kyne-gaites in Ebberston Carr in the common pasture </i>(NRQS4/136); 1659 <i>a twinter gate in the High Cow Pastor, </i>Sedbusk (YRS130/80).

gentleman ,,,,,,,The word ‘gentleman’ was applied properly to a man who was entitled to bear arms but did not rank among the nobility.,"It was deemed important for a gentleman to live without manual labour and it was said by John Ferne (<i>c</i>.1560-1609), the eminent writer on heraldry, that being a merchant was ‘no competent or seemelye trade of lyfe for a gentleman’. From the late 1300s the word was used frequently, after a man’s name, as an indication of his rank: 1399 <i>Thomas Hagthorpe, gentilman</i>, Hemingbrough (YRS120/95); 1426 <i>Richard Lorymer, gentilman</i>, York (SS96/139). It was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that members of the gentry became increasingly conscious of their position or degree, and the subject was one they frequently commented on. After Sir Henry Savile of Methley, had accepted his baronetcy he wrote <i>I desyre neither to be first nor laste; I can be content to followe Mr Wentworth and Sir Henry Bellasis … for any other I yet heare of I may without any great incongruitye be rank’t afore them</i> (Cliffe8). Nevertheless, it was to some extent a man’s neighbours who decided whether or not he was a gentleman, and the right to be addressed as ‘Mr’ was a recognition of that. The status was therefore determined as much by common estimation as by legal distinctions. The Ramsden family of Longley were among the gentry in the Almondbury area from the mid-1500s but early references to William Ramsden, who was the architect of the family’s fortune, seems to reflect a hesitation among his contemporaries about the exact status that he enjoyed. In 1547, for example, he was described as <i>William Ramsden of Longley, Yorkshire, gentleman, alias late of Almondbury ... yeoman, alias of Elland, yeoman, alias late of London, esquire </i>(YAJ42/144n).

German steel ,,,,,,,,"The influence of Continental metal workers is a recurring theme in the history of the iron and steel industry  in Yorkshire, starting with tradesmen from Germany in the lists of York freemen: 1350 <i>Goddescalcus de Smith-husen</i>; 1393 <i>Arnaldus de Colonia, armorer</i>; 1446 <i>Andreas la Monere, fynour</i> (SS96). German steel, or ‘Cullen’ steel (since it was imported via Cologne and the Rhine) were terms used for the steels imported from Central Europe from the late fifteenth century, shortly after the introduction of the blast furnace. In 1681, <i>German steel</i> was sold to scissorsmiths from the common storehouse that had been set up by the Cutlers’ Company in Sheffield, and in 1702 the inventory of a local cutler, Thomas Pearson, included <i>A parcel of German Steel</i> in his smithy (IH).

gersum  ,girsom,gressome,grassom,garsom ,,,"A gersum was a premium or fine, paid by a tenant to his landlord when he entered on his holding.","A set of vessels for table use, typically of pewter. A complete set was for twelve people. In fact, in 1593, such a payment was called ‘an <i>encomin or girsom</i>, but this was a comparatively late reference in Swaledale (YRS152/310). In an undated thirteenth-century charter, probably pre-1279, Thomas, son of Ralph, made a payment <i>in gersuma</i> for land in Hallamshire (TWH14/2); an account roll for Whitby Abbey in 1394-5 contains a list of the ‘firma’ or farms and that is followed by another list of about thirty payments under the heading <i>Gersummæ</i> (SS72/559). Gressome was the usual spelling in the northern counties:  In 1509, the tenant of land at Halton Gill was required, on surrendering his lease, to let it to one of his sons who would then ‘agree with the abbey and convent for his <i>gressome</i>’ (YRS140/28). Like ‘garsom’ the word was often linked directly with ‘fine’: 1572 <i>money in the name of a fine or gressome</i>, Salendine Nook (KM352). In 1651, in a case relating to the lordship of Tong manor it was asked what sums of money the defendant had received <i>for fines and gressomes upon the demiseing of the landes</i> (Mss7b/7). The variant 'garsom' was possibly regional and occurs regularly in documents of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In a dispute over land in Nidderdale, in 1521, John Pulleyn was ordered to pay <i>suche garsome</i> as the arbitrators agreed upon (YRS41/107) and in 1637 the inventory of the effects of Mary Knowles of Hambleton included <i>the benefit of the garsom of two leases</i> (YRS47/98). Frequently, as if clerks feared that ‘garsom’ might not be understood, it is linked with ‘fine’, or with the less usual ‘foregift’. In 1551, an incoming Thurstonland tenant paid £5 5s <i>in the name of a garsom or fyne</i> (YDK73). In a case in <i>c.</i>1570 a landlord noted that he had <i>amendyd the rentes … of such as had rather soote </i>[suit]<i> do than pay a garsom </i>(KayeCP), a context which suggests that this customary payment was unpopular and that tenants preferred to pay an increased rent.

ghaut ,,,,,,,"In Whitby, some of the narrow alleys which link more important streets to the water’s edge are called ‘ghauts’."," I find no evidence that this term has been in use elsewhere along the coast. The alleys are picturesque and much photographed and yet Smith made no mention of the word in <i>The Place-Names of the North Riding</i>. Nor was an explanation of its meaning given in H.P. Kendall’s monograph on <i>The Streets of Whitby</i> (1938), although the author referred incidentally to Alder’s Ghaut, Collier’s Ghaut, Tin Ghaut and Rippon’s Ghaut. The names were evidently remarkably fluid, for Tin Ghaut had two different locations; Alder’s Ghaut was ‘formerly known as Virgin Pump Ghaut’, and Collier’s Ghaut was said to have replaced Horse Mill Ghaut, ‘known as such in 1595’ (HPK32). </br>If the history of the word can indeed be shown to go back to the sixteenth century, it must be presumed that the present spelling has been influenced by the Anglo-Indian word <i>ghaut </i>which has a very similar meaning. In the 1600s, ‘the Ghauts’ was the name given to mountains in southern Hindustan but in the singular it was employed more particularly of narrow defiles or passes, and in 1783 was used to describe a flight of steps leading to the river-side and to the landing place there (OED). Since the artificial cutting on Whitby’s West Cliff was given the name Khyber Pass soon after 1848 it may be that the spelling ‘ghaut’, if not the word, dates from that period.</br>A Whitby glossary of 1855 has an entry for ‘gaut or gote’ and it was defined there as a narrow opening or slip from a street to the shore, and the author quoted ‘Fish gaut’and ‘Horsemill gaut’ as examples. Very similar information is given in J.C. Atkinson’s <i>Glossary of the Cleveland dialect</i> (1868), where the editor also draws attention to the Hindustani word, in the sense of ‘pass or defile’. Wright had an entry in 1900 for ‘gaut’ and included the spelling ‘ghaut’ but no examples of its use (EDD). In fact early references to the place-name are rare, Pigot’s Directory of 1829 for Whitby placed two inns or public houses in <i>Fish Goat</i>; the <i>Jolly Butchers</i> where Sarah Coulson was the landlady and the <i>Seven Stars</i> managed by Thomas Fewster: in Baines’s Directory of 1822 the address was Church Street. </br>It is likely, I believe, that it derives from Middle English <i>gote</i>, used principally of a water-course or channel but adapted in Whitby to the narrow ‘channels’ or alleys which lead down to the river. That seems more probable since the word was used of the 'gote' to the horse mill in 1595 according to H.P. Kendall. This mill belonged at one time to Bagdale Hall and it is mentioned independently from <i>c</i>.1540 when 2s rent was paid for<i> 1 Molendini equine </i>which adjoined William Laverock’s cottage (SS72/722). In fact, ‘gote’ as a mill leat or water channel was in widespread use in Yorkshire over many centuries: 1551 <i>the said lessoure shall buylde … one dame and one gote … to conveye water … to such mill</i>, Thurstonland (YDK73); 1618 <i>a water-sewer called the Lower Goate from Firbie to Exilbie</i> (NRQS2/176).

However, an award in 1628 makes it clear that some cutlers were deceiving unwary purchasers by mixing gold with brass, or silver with tin or pewter, as a consequence of which the rules were strengthened (HCC25).

gingerbread,,,,,,,"Ginger is the rhizome of the tropical plant <i>Zingiber officinale</i>, prized for its hot spicy taste.","It was already being imported into England in the Old English period and was much used both in medicine and cookery. Spellings in the Middle Ages are apparently influenced by forms of the word across Europe and the Arab world, especially Old French <i>gingimbre</i> (OED). In Nesfield, <i>c</i>.1300, <i>unum radicem Zingiberis</i> was due to the lord of the manor in lieu of suit and secular service (CHT109), a quite different spelling from one in the accounts of Bolton Priory: 1307-8 <i>Pro zuker, gyngebr’, croco et aliis speciebus lvs vijd ob</i>. (YRS154/213). This will have been preserved ginger which was dried and ground: 1394-5 <i>It. dim. lib. pulveris zinzebris js viijd</i>, Whitby (SS72/622). Cakes flavoured with ginger were in vogue from at least the fifteenth century, and popular etymology was responsible for the spelling ‘gingerbread’ which came into use from that time: 1562 <i>One ginger breade tempes vjd</i>, Richmond (SS26/163). These cakes became especially popular in Yorkshire in the 1700s and recipes for several varieties have survived (TFY170-6). The spelling remained inconsistent and late examples are <i>ginge-bred</i>, found in the seventeenth-century diary of Dr Kaye of Woodsome (KayeD), and <i>Ginsbread</i>, sold at Halifax Fair in 1720 (QS1/59).

ginnel  ,,,,,,,,"Many dialect words have been lost in recent times but ‘ginnel’ survives in good health, acceptable in polite conversation and even in newspaper articles. In that respect it can be compared with ‘snicket’, as though the two fulfil a role in the language that English somehow cannot match: it must be suspected that most regions have their own equivalents. Early references are scarce and they tell us little about the word’s precise meaning. In 1744, Arthur Jessop the New Mill apothecary wrote that a subpoena had been sent to <i>Joseph Eastwood’s wife in the Ginnil in the Low at Holmfirth</i> (YRS117/90). Similarly, one branch of the Taylor family was said to be of <i>Ginnel</i> in Meltham in 1774 (G-A).</br>In most reference works no clear distinction is drawn between ginnel and snicket, and they are both described as north-country words for a narrow entrance between houses. However, in the Holme Valley I was told that a ginnil ‘goes uphill and has setts whereas a snicket doesn’t – and it hasn’t’. The OED says that it has an obscure etymology but likens the word to ‘channel’ and offers the meaning as ‘a long narrow passage between houses, either roofed or unroofed’. In Wright’s Dialect Dictionary it is contrasted with ‘entry’ which is specifically said to have a roof – unlike a ginnel. The editors of Yorkshire glossaries are less reticent about the etymology and more than one claims a connection between ginnel and a Scandinavian word for ‘mouth’, as though the ginnel was originally an opening.</br>I am unable to contribute to the etymological argument but one or two other references to the word may be of interest. For example, Council minutes printed in the <i>Huddersfield Daily Chronicle</i> show that Councillor Brooke moved a resolution in 1881 that a footway near the Baptist Chapel in New North Road should be closed. In the statements that followed several councillors referred to the footway as a ginnel and said that it was in an unsanitary state. In fact, they also described it as an alley and a road but ginnel was the preferred term when its shocking condition was being mentioned. </br>In a much earlier example there were similarly unpleasant connotations in Manchester. In 1613 Robert Charnock was said to have <i>newly erected a privie, the Filthe whereof Falleth into a certen Gynnell or gutter</i> between his house and one belonging to Thomas Brownsword. It was even claimed that he kept <i>his swine in the same gynnell </i>(MCL2/287). On the other hand it was acceptable for the narrow alleys off Skipton’s High Street to be named as ginnels, and <i>John Ranson’s guinnil</i> had that name as early as 1756 (WHD365).",,YRS117/90,,1744,New Mill,G-A,,1774,Meltham,MCL2/287,,1613,Manchester,WHD365,,1756,Skipton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

gipsy,gypsy,,,,,,,"Gipsies, or Romanies, are said to have first come to this country in the early 1500s.

As early as 1537, a pardon was granted to a ‘company of lewde personnes … calling themselves Gipcyans’, who had been accused of a murder (OED). Actually, people ‘calling themselves Egyptians’ may have been native-born Englishmen, for there were many who used the title so that they too might separate the gullible from their money. In 1729, three Londoners were arrested in Barnsley for <i>wandring in the habit and form of counterfeit Egyptians and pretending to tell fortunes</i> (QS1/71/6).

glaze,glazer,,,,,,"One early meaning of the verb was to make something shine like glass, by rubbing and polishing: it was used of swords and other weapons in 1515 and 1648 (OED).","In the cutlery trade it formerly referred to the stage between grinding and polishing, and a glazing wheel or glazer is said to have rotated at a slower speed than a grindstone. It was described more recently as a complex process which involved the use of many varied wheels: the marks left on a blade after grinding were first removed by a small wooden wheel covered with an emery compound, after which a leather-covered wheel dressed with suet and beeswax was used for polishing: the final lustre was applied by a rag mop wheel (CAT). Examples of the word in Sheffield include: 1590 <i>to grynde or glace anye knyffe or knyf blayds at the said whele</i> (HCC2); 1625 <i>making blades, or grinding or glazing knives or blades</i> (HCC9).

god’s penny  ,,,,,,,"This was a small sum of money, said to have been so called originally because it was intended for a charitable or religious purpose. However, by the Tudor period it had come to be associated principally with bargains, especially as ‘earnest’ money, paid over at a new tenancy agreement or when a servant or workman was first hired."," In 1531, Christopher Scawceby sought to take possession of a public house called the <i>Bull,</i> in Beverley, but his ownership was disputed by John Raffelles and the case was heard at the court of Star Chamber. Much of the evidence had to do with <i>a goddes penney</i> allegedly paid to Scawceby without the landlord’s knowledge (YRS120/80-4). In 1633, Abraham Shaw of Northowram was to <i>hire all workmen and pay them their Godspenies only of his proper cost</i> (HAS31/79). Pepys was certainly familiar with the term, noting in his diary that ‘at the making all contracts and bargains they give so much, which they call God’s penny’ (1662). The same term was used for the small rebate given when cattle were purchased. In 1914, Mrs Jagger said it was considered unlucky in Honley not to have a coin returned as part of a sale, although she described it as <i>God’s silver or luck penny</i> (JH120).

good,goods,,,,,,"We are very familiar with the plural noun ‘goods’, used in the sense of movable property, but formerly the word could also be used for livestock, certainly in Scotland and the north of England.","In 1533 an East Riding lady referred in her will to her <i>quicke goodes, as horse, mayres, sheipe and swyne, and thoder half of my neite</i> (SS106/37). In fact, the word was used frequently in both wills and manorial documents, typically in a by-law of 1635 which warned tenants not to <i>putt any goodes or cattelles into the Townefeilds</i> (WB/M). In 1608, William Atkinson of Malham was fined <i>for eating Scaylgill with his goodes</i> (DD/Ma). </br>It was not unusual for the distinction between the two meanings of ‘goods’ to be drawn in wills, where livestock would be described as ‘quick goods’ and moveables as ‘dead goods’. In 1552, John Scott of Thorp Arch left his <i>goodes, both qwicke and dead</i> to his wife (Th19/328); in a Barwick will of 1593, the testator defined his <i>deade goods</i> as <i>implements of husbandrye or household stuff</i> (PR). ‘Quick good’, in the singular, was quite often the mortuary left by a parishioner to the minister of the local church: 1516 <i>I bequeathe for my mortuarie my best quyke goode</i>, Ryton (SS106/1). Similarly, in 1485, Margaret Piggot left her <i>best quyke goode to the kyrke</i> (SS64/275). According to Wright this meaning of the word was still in use in the second half of the nineteenth century, and examples occurred not only in the northern counties but as far south as Derbyshire and Staffordshire.

gossip  ,,,,,,,,"At the present day this word is most commonly used, in a rather pejorative way, of a person who delights in idle chatter, and yet historically ‘gossips’ were people who shared a spiritual affinity via the godparent relationship.

Examples of the common noun occur frequently from the Tudor period, particularly in testamentary material: in 1485, for example, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, left to his <i>gossep, Mr William Poteman</i> … <i>a tonne of wyne of Gascoigne, yerelie </i>(SS45/308). However, the significance of the relationship is more apparent in an extract from a will written in 1560, which reveals how ‘gossips’ could share the same Christian name and be of service to one another throughout their lives: 1560 <i>I, Robert Hudson of Barkeston, … gyve to my gotsipp Robart Man, for his paynes takynge in drawynge of this my last will and also for makyng my new lease betwixt Mr Barkeston and me, iijs iiijd </i>(SS26/254).

grass  ,girse,gress,,,,,"The word ‘grass’ was commonly used in the past in the sense of pasture, as either a noun or a verb, and it had so many variant spellings that it can sometimes be difficult to recognise.","When Robert Casson of Leeds made his will in 1539 he first requested that his son <i>suffer Elizabethe, his mother, to have one cowe gressed … without … payinge any thinge for the said cowe girse</i>, and then asked that Robert Leadbetter<i> have a cowe girssed within the same close</i> (Th19/10). Compounds similar to <i>cowe girse</i>, that is pasture for one cow, are not uncommon, for example: 1494 <i>j hors gresse in parva prata</i>, Markingfield (SS81/164); 1517 to have a <i>horsgrys</i> in the said close, Bridge Hewick (YRS83/120). The verb ‘to grass’, meaning to pasture, occurs much earlier than that: in York, those who granted pasture rights to non-citizens had to pay a toll, or, as it was expressed in 1484 <i>every person that gyrsys horsys of strangers that commys to thys Cite pay … iiijd</i> (YRS98/92).

grassfarm,grasshouse,grassman,gerse,grisse house,,,"There is a reference to 'Hurdmannis et Bondis et Gresmannis' <i>c</i>. 1150, where the context makes it clear that a grassman was a certain class of tenant (OED).","It has been suggested that it was then equivalent in meaning to cottar or cottier, that is a villein tenant in possession of a cottage. However, in an extent of Peter of Savoy’s lands in 1280, the average annual rent of cottars was 3s, twice the rent paid by those tenants <i>qui vocantur gresmanni</i> (YRS12/223). This implies an even lower status.</br>Direct comparisons can be made between a husbandman and a grassman: in 1461, William Bardsey of Nidd made bequests of one shilling to each of the husbandmen in his township but only six pence to each <i>gresman</i> (SS64/100); in 1542, a husbandman of Scruton was allowed to keep two geese and one gander, whereas a <i>gresseman</i> was restricted to one goose and one gander (YRS39/149). The word ‘grass house’ throws further light on this matter: in a tithe dispute in Heworth, in 1542, one tenant was referred to as a <i>gresman, havyng but a gressehows</i>: such a tenant was allowed to keep only twenty sheep <i>by reason of his dwelling hows</i>. One of these grassmen testified that <i>every inhabitant there dwellyng in a gresse howse … havynge no arrable land langyng </i>[belonging]<i> to itt may kepe no mo shep but xx</i> (YRS114/14-16). A survey of Settrington in 1600 listed <i>grasse fermes wich haue Arrable groundes butt not sufficient to make them husbandries</i> (YRS126/3). Other references emphasise the status of a grasshouse: 1551 <i>To every pour gerse house in Morton</i> [upon Swale], <i>iiijd</i> (SS26/71); 1557 <i>To every grisse house within the parishe which hath no corne growing one busshell of rye</i>, Kirby (SS26/102).</br> Over the centuries the word ‘grassman’ may have developed significant regional distinctions, particularly as villein status declined, but it clearly emphasises the dependence of certain tenants on pasture as opposed to arable. In the North Riding in 1624 the holdings rated as <i>grasse-houses</i> were contrasted with those which had <i>Oxeganges</i> (NRQS3/215): in 1638, when the tax rate of different properties was commented on at the West Riding Quarter Sessions, properties were rated as follows: <i>for a husbandrye xvjd; for a grassehouse viijd; for a cottage iiijd</i>.

In Ripon in 1396-7 a carpenter was working on <i>j cameram et j grece</i> (SS81/125) and in a Stokesley will of 1497 a gentleman asked to be <i>beried in the qwer … at the grece befor Saint Petyr</i> (SS53/128).

grinder ,,,,,,,Grinding is the process in the cutlery trade which smooths a blade to the desired thickness and gives it a cutting edge.,"Specialist shear-grinders operated in some major towns from as early as 1345, and scythe-grinding was a distinct occupation from <i>c.</i>1600 at least. For the most part though cutlers and other metal workers rented a seat at a grindstone for a few hours at a time or had their own grindstones on the premises. In 1697, for example, Michael Fox had a smithy with all the usual smithy gear but also possessed axletrees, glazers, stones, <i>a wheelband</i> and <i>certain puleys at the grinding wheel</i> (IH). James Tailior of Heeley divided his real estate between two sons when he made his will in 1554 but James the elder son had his two <i>weles; that is to say, the whele on the Farrside and the whele in the Nooke</i>, whereas Robert was to <i>have one day gryndynge every weeke</i> but was obliged to <i>gyve the said James warnynge on the Sonday what day he will have yt</i> (TWH16/87). The first references to the occupation are in York: 1387 <i>Johannes Hunteplace, grynder; Johannes de Catton, grynder</i> (SS96/86). In the south Yorkshire cutlery trade it occurred comparatively late: 1700 <i>Joshua Slacke grinder</i>, Sheffield (PR5/63); 1702 <i>fil’ Will’i Blonke grinder</i>, Sheffield (PR4/187).

The cutlers’ grindstones were mostly water-powered, and the quality of the stone available in the Sheffield area is seen as one of the major reasons for the success there of the cutlery trade. In 1637, John Harrison considered the <i>course grinding stones for knives and scithes</i> to be a major local resource and they were probably in use by up to 500 master workmen by that time (FBH56). The alternative word, grindlestone, is recorded from the thirteenth century, notably in the alliterative poem <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: As one vpon a gryndelston hade grounden a syþe</i> (OED). It was common in Yorkshire from the sixteenth century: 1534 <i>a stone troughe, a gryndle ston</i>, Liversedge (Th24/311); 1583 <i>for a gryndle-stone 2s 4d</i>, York (SS35/119); 1639 <i>Item grinelstones</i>, Swinsty (YRS134/92).  The places where grindstones were quarried or stored are commemorated in some minor place-names, e.g. Grindstone Hill, Grinding Stone Hole, Grinnel Stones (PNWR8/77); the cliffs at Whitby: 1544-5 <i>lapidum vocatam gryndelstones in lez cliffes</i> (MC364).

In Yorkshire, both Beverley and Ripon had similar rights.","Once safely within the church the sanctuary seeker was known as a ‘grithman’ or ‘girthman’ and a by-name provides an early example of the word: 1297 <i>Paulin Grithman</i>, Beverley (YRS16/151). In 1342, pardons were granted <i>ad omnes homines vocatas grithmen</i> if they agreed to fight the Scots (SS74/80). Both spellings occur in fifteenth-century records: 1458 <i>confugæ sive gyrthmanij</i>, Ripon (SS64/72); 1460 <i>nullus Grithmannus ejusdem ville</i>, Beverley (BTD51). Within Ripon church was a stone called the grithstone: 1228 <i>et infra portam cimiterij et locum qui vocatur Grythstane</i>, Ripon (SS74/51): in an earlier undated reference it was <i>the stane that Grythstole hatte</i>;that is ‘is named’(SS74/90). The sanctuary seekers were ministered to by a ‘grithpriest’: 1392 <i>in tenura domini Johannis vocati le Grithpreste</i>, Ripon (SS81/105). In 1471, John Eksmyth, <i>gyrthman</i> of Ripon, sought permission to carry the<i> gyrthrod</i> which was apparently a stave with a banner, borne by the grithmen at Rogation-tide (SS64/383).

grocer ,,,,,,,"We are accustomed to think of the grocer as a tradesman who dealt in spices, sugar, dried fruits and other items of domestic consumption but the term was not prominent in the fourteenth century, unlike 'mercer' and 'spicer', and in that period it more probably referred to an 'engrosser', that is a wholesaler:","<i>c</i>.1450 <i>no groser of fysche awe to cut hys awn fysche be hym selffe</i>, Malton (SS85/63).

Fifty years later it could still have that meaning: in 1585 Edward Osborne of London informed the Earl of Shrewsbury that nutmeg was sold <i>unto the grosers which take towe or thre houndereth ponds wourthe at a tyme</i>(Sh14). There are early references to grocers, for example, 1403 <i>Ricardus Beche, grocer</i>, York (SS96/108); 1504 <i>John Lupton, Ledes grocer</i> (YRS6/107) but these are unlikely to have been retailers. We can be sure though that John Hubye of Selby, <i>grosser</i>, who died in 1663, was more like a grocer in the modern sense, since his inventory lists the scores of items that were then in his shop.

These were imports from Danzig, and the editor defined ‘groff’ as ‘coarse’: the second element is the northern ‘garn’ for ‘yarn’. Examples of these two words independently are on record in Hull and York well before those in the OED. ‘Gruff’ for example is noted there only from 1533 but features regularly in the Hull accounts: 1463 <i>1 pece panni linii Gruff</i> (YRS144/56); <i>3 M ulnis groflewant</i> (YRS144/59). These were coarse linen cloths and the repeated use of ‘groff’ seems to indicate that it was the Dutch or Low German word, introduced here in commercial use.

ground work ,,,,,,,Foundations. ," In 1422, the masons responsible for Catterick Bridge were required to <i>make riddeye groundes in the watir ware the brigge schalle be</i>, that is prepare the sites for the abutments and pillars (NRQS3/35). In ideal circumstances that would have meant finding an area of solid rock and clearing it of loose material, if necessary excavating the river bed. Failing that, an area suitable for piling would have to be prepared. That was doubtless the meaning of the phrase <i>clensyng of the ground werk</i> used of Lady’s Bridge in Sheffield in 1485-6 (HS1/59). In 1579, the <i>growndworke of ... the landstayes </i>of Elland Bridge referred specifically to the foundations (HAS35) and in 1601, help was given to the mason at Apperley Bridge <i>to sett the ground worke</i> once the water had been drawn off (BAS6/142).

grove (2),groove,,,,,,,"‘Grove’ in the sense of a small wood is rare in Yorkshire where ‘grave’ and ‘greave’ are more usual as place-name elements.

On 5 November 1785, a Slaithwaite diarist wrote <i>unruly work this day, and especially at night, having a Fire before Landlord Sykes’s door, ringing a bell and going on the Houses till after midnight</i> (KC242/1). Almost a century earlier, in 1686, the diarist Abraham de le Pryme commented on the banning of bonfires and fireworks by the authorities, saying that it was obvious to <i>the vulgar and everyone</i> that the authorities were intent on <i>the hindering of rejoicings and sports on gunpowder treason night</i> (SS54/10).",,KC242/1,,1785,Slaithwaite,SS54/10,,1686,np,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gutter ,,,,,,,An artificial watercourse.,"The word is found commonly in the York House Books from the early fifteenth century, descriptive of a drainage system that took rainwater and possibly household refuse into the Ouse and other waterways: 1418-9 <i>gutters of lede ... and that the water be ledde downe of their bather coste</i>, York (SS85/13); 1420 <i>that bathe the parteys make and uppehalde the gutter als ferre als yt reches </i>(SS85/17): 1420 <i>all the tymbre that sall ga un to the gutter</i>, York (SS85/15). Both lead and wood were employed in making the gutters and they seem likely to have conveyed water from the eaves of houses to ground level and so into the dykes and rivers: 1476 <i>thai deme a gutter that liggez in lengh frome the streit of Petirgate be fore doun thrugh a tenement ... to the Kyng’s dyke ... which said gutter and the leid ther of ... pertenyth evenly to ...

In 1501, an entry refers to <i>a gutter whiche </i>[Ric’ Thornton] <i>hath laid and festened unto a tenement </i>(SS85/22). There may have been a similar practice in Ripon: 1392-3 <i>Et in salario Ricardi de Bettes facientis guturas cum spowtis super quamdam novam cameram</i> (SS81/113).

hagg,,,,,,,"Of Old Norse origin; a word for a place where trees were felled, a clearing.","In the earliest references the precise meaning is usually in doubt: 1315 'for escapes in the <i>Hagge</i> he is amerced 8d', Rastrick (YRS78/83); 1488 <i>I wylle that my sone Robert have resnabylle ways when he wylle sell ony hages at Ernclyfe</i>, Ingleby Arncliffe (YAJ16/223). It acquired different shades of meaning regionally but came to be used in coppice management for a portion of a wood marked out for felling. In a monastic survey of  <i>c.</i>1540, High Wood in Hampole near Doncaster had <i>18 coppices called haggs, viz 1 of the age of 18 years another of the age of 17 years and so in succession from year to year</i>: the wood contained 120 acres and an eighteen-year coppice cycle was operated (YRS80/122). There was an overlap in meaning with ‘fall’, ‘spring’ and ‘copy’: in 1524, for example, woodland in Thorpe Underwood was leased to Francis Man, who had the right to make an annual <i>copye ande hagge of the said woodes and spryngies in fagottes</i> (YRS140/109). In 1534, Henry Babthorpe bequeathed his lands to his sons who were not to take profit from them nor sell them, but might have <i>suche hagges and falles as have been yearlie accustomed to be felled, kidded and solde </i>(SS106/48): the words faggot and kid had much the same meaning and both could be used for fuel. In 1577-8, the names <i>of the Fawles & Hagges</i> in Settrington included <i>one springe</i> called <i>the Bushell Hagge</i> (YRS126/101). From the late Middle Ages it was a common element in minor place-names: 1540 <i>iiij hagges or sprynges within ... the outwoddes of Selby wherof one ys called Sparke Hagg</i> (YRS13/351); 1645 <i>with the herbage of twoe springe woodes thereunto adjoining upon the south and west sides of one wood called the Hagge</i>, Honley (G-A).

handles ,,,,,,,"As a noun this occurs frequently in the inventories of cloth-dressers and it had a very specific meaning. Briefly, the 'handles' were a wooden frame set with teasles which was used to raise the nap on cloth. ","It was a tenchique that required skill, and which changed over the years and from one region to another: the history of ‘handles’ is told in specialist works on the cloth industry. One of the most explicit references is the earliest that I have noted: 1484 <i>every walker shall walk the said cloth and clothez sufficiently … so that thay be as wele walked in oon place as in an othere, and wroght with dede handils as apperteyneth</i>, York (YRS98/95).

I note the following explanation of ‘course’ in <i>The Cloth Industry in the West of England</i> (OUP, 1971): ‘the number of courses given with the handles varied with the quality of the cloth and was sometimes large; mention of twenty-six and twenty-nine course handles can be found’. </br> The term ‘a brake of handles’ was frequent from the seventeenth century: 1618 <i>half a brack of handls and scraths</i>, Bingley (LRS1/54); 1687 <i>one brake of handles</i>, Linthwaite (IMF); 1702 <i>a brake of handles</i>, Holmfirth (IH).

By an extension of that meaning a ‘head’ could also be the end of a drift or gallery, a solid or apparently solid wall of coal. </br> It is important to say ‘apparently’ because in districts where the coal was being exploited by more than one group of miners, the ‘head’ might be only a very short distance from the workings in a neighbouring pit. That point is illustrated in the testimony of a collier named John Cordingley who was working for Mr Edward Stanhope in Bradford in 1702. He was <i>getting coals in the pitt, </i>he said, when <i>one John Booth of Bowling, collier, struck a head through into the place where he … was working under the ground.</i> Other workers came through the hole and confronted Cordingley, telling him <i>to get his cloaths gathered up and be gone</i> (QS1).",drive; encroachment; strait; waterhead,YA12/236,,1486,Cortworth,SpSt5/4/1/5,,1728,Horsforth,HM/C/10,,1777,Southowram,QS1,,1702,Bradford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hearth,,,,,,,The fireplace in a smith’s forge.,"The OED has an explicit example in 1398 but then a gap in the evidence until 1645.

The returns for Ladyday 1672 name the owners of about 600 smithies in and just beyond Hallamshire; Sheffield as a township had 224 recorded smithies; that is one for every 2.2 households (FBH94-5).

Compound terms which include the word are <i>footeheble</i> in 1664, dealt with separately, and <i>heble-bridge</i> between Ribstone and Deighton in 1688 (QS1/27/1).

This meaning may be implicit in Henry Best’s advice in 1642 that <i>yow putte over two hebbles, one higher then the other, to serve for them to leane against</i> (DW20). He was writing about a sheep wash, not a bridge, but documents touching on the condition of Breaks Bridge in 1682 mention that twenty years earlier workmen had taken up the planks and laid new ones: they <i>also hebled itt on both sides </i>[so]<i> that horses with Packs and also footmen might safely pass. </i>The <i>small plancke bridge for one horse onely</i> was then replaced by a stone bridge, but the local inhabitants sought to have it rated as <i>an Heble-bridge’</i> since they were still responsible for its maintenance (QS1).

Nicholas Tyas and his wife, of Wragby in the West Riding, were found guilty in 1602 of illegally pulling up <i>Quicksettes</i> and burning them (YRS3/218-9). However, an Act had been passed in 1601 to deal with what was clearly a growing problem across the county, and ‘the breaking or cutting any hedge, pales, rails or fence was made punishable by whipping’ (SAL7/48-9). In 1609, several men were presented at the Northallerton Quarter Sessions for ‘breaking of hedges’ and in 1611-2 William Jackson was indicted ‘for breaking Lord Rutland’s hedges and burning them in his house’ (NRQS1/246). Examples of the term ‘hedge-breaker’ are recorded soon afterwards: 1614 <i>Order for the sound whipping of the Thirsk hedge-breakers on the markett day in open markett by the Constable of Thirsk, so manie of them as are not able to make restitution to the parties grieved … the women being of the part of Thirsk hedge-breakers</i>  (NRQS2/44).

hedgerow,,,,,,,,"Although one example of this word is on record from the Old English period, the other references in the OED date only from 1577, although ‘hedge’ was frequent throughout the intervening period.

The inference is that the emphasis is on the timber trees which were placed at intervals throughout the length of a hedge: 1619 ‘to plant, set, preserve and cherish twelve oak plants and twelve ash plants in the hedges’, Austby (YRS65/20). The authors of the book <i>Hedges</i> (1974) thought there was no ‘useful distinction to be made between hedgerow and hedge’ but this evidence suggests that hedgerow developed its meaning when hedges became a source of great timber: it defined that extension of their function.

helm,helm timber,helm wood,,,,,A regional term for an outbuilding.,"Place-name evidence take the word’s history back to the twelfth century (PNWR2/225) and as a vocabulary item it is on record soon afterwards: 1309-10 <i>Pro emendacione cuiusdam domus apud Preston et j helme iiijs iiijd</i>, Bolton Priory (YRS154/272); 1420-1 ‘<i>le Helm</i> within the park’, Kippax (WYAS758). Evidence from the sixteenth century suggests that it was then an open-fronted shelter for wains and carts and it is likely that a loft was used as storage space for husbandry gear, straw and wood. ‘Helm wood’ or the like is a frequent term, especially in East Riding documents and it may have included or referred to the wood of which the helm was constructed: 1510 <i>To Richard my soone … the helme tymber</i>, Rotsea (SS79/10); 1535 <i>Item wode on the helme, xijd,</i> Mappleton (SS26/12); 1577 <i>iij stayes </i>[ladders]<i> with a helme woodd an apaltree</i> [axaltre?] <i>with other woode</i>, North Frodingham (YAJ36/450); 1581 <i>certaine woode within the garthe bothe the helme wood and other smale wood with two fleakes and two yates and other wood, </i>South Cave (Kaner116). West Riding examples include: 1668 <i>1 helme, 11 loads of wood, £4. 8</i>, Selby (YRS47/131); 1676 <i>In the Fould 1 helme, 1 yate with the powles belonge to the helme</i>, Barley (YRS47/75). There are several references to props or poles in connection with helms and that may imply that it was a simple timber structure which could easily be erected and taken down: 1589 <i>Item 16 sparres & an helme prop</i>, South Cave (Kaner157). In a Latin text of 1519, reference is made to <i>totum meremium lignorum pertinens iiij helmis,</i> Skelton (SS79/102). The teazle growers in Yorkshire used ‘temporary wooden sheds or <i>ellums’</i> (YAJ56/163), almost certainly a spelling which reflects the dialect pronunciation of ‘helm’. One such structure is shown in George Walker’s <i>Costumes of Yorkshire</i> (1814).

Canon Atkinson said of <i>Houle Becke</i>, recorded in 1664, that it was ‘a local name of frequent occurrence in North Yorkshire’ (NRQS4/163n).

hollin ,,,,,,,A regional word for the holly.,"Found commonly in place-names, sometimes as a specific, e.g. Hollingreave, Holmfirth and Hollinghirst, at other times as the generic, e.g. Broad Hollin, Green Hollins and Thickhollins. The frequency of these names testifies to the former importance of holly as winter fodder, a practice for which there is abundant documentary evidence: 1316 ‘Adam del Grene gives 4s 6d to have six beasts feeding on the hollins in the <i>Holnefrith</i> for the winter’ (YRS57/101); 1592 ‘four hollin trees in a close … and liberty to come and go to the hollins at all times of the year, for cutting, felling and carrying away of the branches … for feeding of sheep’, East Morton (YRS50/138).

In 1526, at Winsley near Ripley, the tenant was granted <i>a parcel of hollynge</i> with his tenement which was <i>markyde and abownded</i> (YRS140/187). In Sheffield, stands of hollins on the common were called ‘hags’: 1574 <i>one hage of hollen at Bell Hagg letten to Phillipe Morton … for 5s a yeare</i> (HS10).

hollow,,,,,,, In coal-mining contexts this verb had the same meaning as ‘to hole’.,"Commenting on a case from 1713 W.B. Trigg said that ‘the defendant paid 30s for hollowing to the new pitt’, which suggests that this gallery linked the two shafts and was intended as a ventilation gate (HAS30/142). He employed the term ‘hollow work’ for when colliers or sinkers broke through into ground where the coal had already been mined: 1815 ‘the coal had been worked from the Cold Harbour pit and the hurrying road led … from the hollow work to Cold Harbour pit’ (HAS31/99). Gresley defined ‘hollows’ as old abandoned workings. In Colsterdale, the term ‘old man’ was used in such cases by both coal-miners and lead-miners: 1707 <i>The field is the hardest I have worked … but should last long after I am dead. The Old Man has worked the field so it was either drowned out or nipped</i> (BM82/58).",,HAS30/142,,1713,np,HAS31/99,,1815,np,BM82/58,,1707,Colsterdale,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

horse (1),rider,,,,,,,"This word occurs in colliery accounts when the miners had encountered a problem.

A definition is quoted from a work on mining in Cornwall, that is: ‘dead ground in a lode which widens like a horse’s back from the spine’, and an example is given from 1778. The same analogy is apparent in the use of ‘mare’, which is dealt with under that heading, and possibly in the alternative ‘rider’, found in the <i>Craven Glossary</i>. It is defined there as the intrusion into the vein of ‘heterogeneous matter’. </br> The Yorkshire evidence is rather earlier: 1718 <i>to John Wilkinson gate up the horse</i>, Farnley (MS14); 1783<i> a coalpit … set upon a horse or fault that runs across part of the estate</i>, Batley (Sheard15).

That is almost certainly the meaning of ‘piked howe’ which was in widespread use through the Middle English period: 1250-1 <i>usque ad Pikedhow de Cravenshalswath</i>, Souther Scales (Furn2/326); 1383 ‘from <i>le Pykedhowe</i> towards the south’, Guisborough (YRS120/107); 1707 <i>to a place called Pyke how</i>, Brompton Moor (NRR1/111).

howetree ,hole-tree,,,,,,,"I find no mention of this rare word in standard works of reference. Salzman could offer no meaning but quoted two examples, one in 1318 when <i>howetrys</i> were used to repair a weir in Nottingham (SZ1/85) and the other in 1377 when <i>uno grosso houuetre</i> was a major timber in a dam in York (SZ1/454). Similarly, in 1399-1400 the expenditure on repairs to the Leeds mill dam included money for <i>howetrees</i> in the timber requirements (Th45/76). it is clear that ‘howe trees’ were timbers used in the construction of water defences, possibly evidence for 'three-dimensional timber-framing', as suggested by McDonnel and others, but their exact function remains uncertain. If one<i> holtre</i> forfeited by a Yeadon tenant in 1403 (SW119) shares the same origin they may have been hollowed or grooved beams but just how they were used has not been explained. </br> That is not the sum total of the evidence. In 1483, the townsmen of Selby faced the possibility that the Ouse might overflow its banks, and repairs were called for. Their request for action includes the following statement: <i>the ground gos away and ... with owt it be amendyd is lyke to mescheffe all the gates of Owsgate & all the howynge that bondys of the watter ... we desyer that my Lord ... wald gyff us tymber that we may mayke a comyne seghe </i>(SS85/29). The exact meaning here may be unclear but ‘the howynge’ seems certain to refer to the river defences and I suspect that ‘seghe’ should be ‘soghe’, that is a sough or drain. This was evidently seen as a solution to the problem. In 1612-16, the timber for a mill in Holmfirth listed <i>soyle trees and hovetwood</i> (DD/RA/f/4a). </br> Two additional references suggest that ‘howing’ was work done by carpenters: 1520 <i>Item pro di. thowsand howeyg nales </i>[howeyng?]<i> 3½d</i>, Ripon (SS81/206); 1613-4 <i>my working toles, half my armesaw ... my thwartsaw, my handsaw ... two howing axes, one hatchet,</i> Hampsthwaite (SS110/34) but note in the inventory of a blacksmith: 1543 <i>Item ij howe yrons</i>, Ripley (SS26/43).

imp yard ,,,,,,,,"In Old English <i>impa</i> had to do with the young shoots of plants and then of grafted shoots, and it clearly retained those meanings into the post-Conquest period. Indeed, imp yards were once a common feature of the English landscape, certainly in the northern counties where the place-name is quite common. A Durham imp yard is quoted in the OED for 1337-8, but it may be the only reference in the dictionary. Early Yorkshire examples include: 1366 <i>Imposyearde</i> [sic], Methley (Th35/142); 1380 <i>le Ymppezherd</i>, Aughton (YAJ12/104); 1385 <i>le Impezerd</i>, Rotherham (YRS111/143). In more northerly parts of Yorkshire, and in other northern counties, an alternative term which had the same meaning is imp garth, and examples there take the word back even further. They include <i>c</i>.1250 <i>Ympegard</i>’ in Cumberland (PNCu) and two instances in Yorkshire: 1259 <i>Impegarde</i>, Follifoot near Harrogate (YRS65/70); 1454 <i>the ympegarth</i>, Kirkby Malham (Morkill235). The inference is that imp yards were originally enclosures where young trees were nurtured, possibly a kind of specialist market garden or plantation. That is partly confirmed by a document dated 1414 which records the indictment of a Methley man called John Cook: he was accused of stealing wood from the <i>Impeyeardes</i> that belonged to the lord of the manor, and the clerk conveniently added the words ‘to wit young oaks’, so it is clear that the offender had been stealing saplings (Th35/171). We do not know how old a term imp yard is nor when it began to fall into disuse, but several examples quoted above occurred in contexts which suggest that it may have been in decline by the 1500s. That is implicit in the field name <i>Cowe close otherwise ympyarde</i>, listed in the Dissolution survey for the priory of Hampole in <i>c</i>.1540 (YRS80/121). Some sites can still be identified: in Kirkburton, for example, a terrier of the glebe lands in 1684 included a meadow called <i>Imp-yard </i>which butted on the graveyard at its southern end. It is mentioned in later terriers but cannot be found on maps which date from 1753. However, the boundaries of the glebe lands are shown, so we know that the present extension to the cemetery marks the site of the former ‘imp yard’.",,Th35/142,,1366,Methley,YAJ12/104,,1380,Aughton,YRS111/143,,1385,Rotherham,PNCu,,c.1250,Cumberland,YRS65/70,,1259,Follifoot near Harrogate,Morkill235,,1454,Kirkby Malham,Th35/171,,1414,Methley,YRS80/121,,c.1540,Hampole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The verb ‘to take in’ features regularly from this period.

Over the centuries the intakes continued to nibble away at the moorland in the upland townships, establishing a characteristic pattern of irregular enclosures at the highest level of cultivation. A survey of 1805, which is in the Dartmouth estate office at Slaithwaite, provides an insight into the labour which created this intake landscape:  </br><i>A great portion of these hamlets have been cultivated from Moorland by the present tenants and their Forefathers within the last Century ...

The inference is that a ‘bare’ wain was one with wheels that were not bound with iron: 1404 ‘one cart<i> cum rotis nudis’</i>, Selby (SAR133) and there is good evidence to suggest that iron-bound wains were those with iron-bound wheels: 1551 <i>that Jenett my wyff have one yronbond wayn, and where thatt one of the wheilles of the wayn is unbounde I wull that my wyff take one other wheill that has the yron to bynd the other with</i>, Knaresborough (SS104/59); 1624 <i>Item a wayne with boonde wheeles furnished</i>, Birstwith (YRS55/111). Such wheels had metal tyres which were nailed to the wooden felloes, and the large-headed studs protruded, as in a cart on the Luttrell psalter <i>c</i>.1342: it must be presumed that these gave the wheels a better grip and were longer lasting.

The ore was for his smithies at West Bretton and if he exceeded the permitted amount he was to pay 13½d a <i>dosand</i>. The mines were referred to in 1579 as <i>stone delfes</i> in a context that makes it clear they were ironstone delves (YRS69/40).

jet,jetter,jet worker,,,,,"Jet is a hard black mineral, found on Yorkshire’s east coast and much used formerly for making jewellery and buttons, especially rosary beads.","1351 <i> et unum ciphum calcidoniae cum uno coopertorio de gete,  </i>Spofforth (SS4/58); 1404 <i> unum superaltare de blakegete </i>, York (SS4/334); 1408 <i> j pare gete bedes gaudez dargent </i>, Plumpton (CHT105); 1433 <i> unum par precularium de geet </i>, York (SS30/26); 1498 <i> a paire of geyet bedes </i>, Wakefield (YAJ15/93); 1559 <i> one paire of geate beads with lyttil beads of currell xvjd, </i> Gatherley (SS26/143); 1618 <i> my jerkin with jete buttons </i>, Abbotside (YRS130/42). From the early seventeenth century there is evidence that it was being mined and worked in and around Whitby: 1616 Richard <i> Tipladie, jeat worker</i>, East Row; William Cook, <i> jeat-worker </i>, Whitby (NRQS2/154). It should be noted that ‘jet-worker’ interchanged with ‘jetter’: 1614 Francis<i>  Trewett, jeater, </i> Skinningrove in Brotton; 1616 Francis <i> Trewhitt, jeat worker </i>, Brotton (NRQS2/67,144). This suggests that ‘jetter’ which occurred earlier as both a by-name and occupation may have had that sense. References have been noted three major locations in the fourteenth century: 1301 <i> Gilbert Getour </i>, Guisborough (YRS21/32); 1321-24 <i> William le Getour </i>, Hull (YRS141/57); 1377 <i> John Coke, getour; William Jetour, </i>Hull (PTER189,192); 1386 <i> John Getour </i>; 1404 <i> Thomas Bysshop, getour </i>, York (SS96). Although it has to be considered a possibility that ‘getour’ could in some cases be used in the sense of ‘braggart’, a meaning given in the OED, the coastal locations of such occupational names is evidence that these were men who procured and/or worked jet, possibly by mining or from pieces cast up on the shore.

jetty  ,,,,,,,From a word of French origin which meant ‘to throw’. It referred in particular to the projecting upper storeys of timber buildings.,"1338 <i> gettes et efsdropes </i>, York (YRS111/182). The deed in which this reference occurs had to do with an upper room in a congested part of the city, and similar documents indicate that the dimensions of any overhanging storey were a matter for concern. In 1418, a property in Peasholm occupied a site on the side of St Cuthbert’s churchyard and those who were seeking to build houses on the plot were given the right to a <i> gette </i> of reasonable size into the churchyard (SS186/42). In Beverley, as late as 1690, there was a penalty of £20 for any person who encroached on the street by building up to the <i>outend of the geetyes </i> (YRS84/180). There were other meanings: a ‘jetty’ could be an internal feature of a building as the following bequest proves: 1578 <i>To my brother Richard a jettie and a mowsteade in my overbarne</i>, Newton in Bowland (CS3/7). In other contexts a ‘jetty’ could be part of complicated river defences, e.g. 1717 <i> For making a getty in the water and cutting a cut through the stonery … to be wear’d on each side </i>, Hampsthwaite (QS1/57/8). It is difficult to be certain of the exact meaning in this extract but it occurred in a bridge-builder’s estimate so it is worth noting that the OED has ‘jetty’ from 1772 in the sense of ‘starling’, that is stonework surrounding a bridge pier. In 1554, Bridlington pier was being repaired after an October storm and enough timber had been saved by the diligence of the townsmen to construct <i> the sonken Joties which be moost necessary defences between the mayne pere and the Sourge of the See </i> (YRS80/71). It was used even earlier as an alternative to ‘quay’: 1489 <i> the Getye and Key of our towne of Scarborow </i> (NRR1/122).",jutty,YRS111/182,,1338,York,SS186/42,,1418,Peasholm,YRS84/180,,1690,Beverley,CS3/7,,1578,Newton in Bowland,QS1/57/8,,1717,Hampsthwaite,YRS80/71,,1554,Bridlington,NRR1/122,,1489,Scarborough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jewel,jowel,,,,,,Examples in the OED date from 1516 and the meaning given is  ‘a pier or supporter of a wooden bridge’: Marshall defined it in 1788 as ‘the starling of a wooden bridge’.,"In some other Yorkshire examples that meaning is more or less confirmed but even in early references the bridges were sometimes made of stone: 1485-6 <i> the making a Brygge of ston ... the which shall be made V arches embowed, iiij jowels and ij heedys with sure butments</i>, Sheffield (HS1/59). In 1579, Elland Bridge was to have <i> two substantiall juells or pyllors </i> but again it was made of stone (BAS6/138). In other cases the jowels were certainly of timber: 1589 <i> Item paid for timber for making fower paire of jewells and one odd jewell, for 33 sommers and 30 planckes £18 19s,  </i>How Bridge (NRQS3/24). Nor is the meaning always straightforward: Wright had ‘The arch or space between the piers’ for ‘jowel’ but quoted Marshall’s definition for ‘jewel’ in a separate entry (EDD). In the 1683 lease of the Wakefield Bridge House, the jewel was more the foundation of the pier than the pier itself, for one clause in the agreement referred to <i> any of the Stones commonly called Setters within any of the frames or Jewells under the bridg,  </i>Wakefield<i>   </i>(QS1). The word remained in use into relatively recent times: 1745-6 <i> Whitby Bridge, which is a county bridge, and that the jewells or supporters ... are not wide enough for the said ship to come through ... unless one inch and half of each side be chipped or cut away from the said jewells  </i>(NRQS8/252).",,HS1/59,,1485-6,Sheffield,BAS6/138,,1579,Elland Bridge,NRQS3/24,,1589,How Bridge,QS1,,1683,Wakefield,NRQS8/252,,1745-6,Whitby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The precise meaning of Kendal as a place-name is less obvious than might be thought, for it did not refer to the present borough of Kendal in earlier centuries but to the dale or valley of the river Kent: the original name of the town was Kirkby Kendal and it was not until much later that the affix came to be used of the town itself. It is not always clear to an outsider when the name ‘Kendal’ applies to the borough, the valley, the Barony of Kendal, or Kendal Ward, the wapentake which covered the greater part of the south of the county.

kendalman ,,,,,,,The sale of the fabric we know as Kendal was associated with merchants known as kendalmen.,"1394-5 ‘John of <i>Kendale</i> 1 pack of 12 pieces of strait cloths’, Pontefract, Howden and Selby (YRS64/39); 1546 <i>Also it is agreyd that all Kendelmen bryngyng any Kendell clothe to this Citie to be sold shall bryng the same to the said Comon Hall payng for every pakk iiijd for howse room</i> (YRS108/140). A kendalman was just as much a seller of kendal cloth as he was a man from Kendal. In that context it should be said that ‘kendalman’ occurs early enough as both a by-name and vocabulary item for it not to refer directly to the town: 1379 <i>Walter Kendalman</i>, Rosgill (PTWe); 1471 <i>pelegiagium cujusdam Kendaleman</i> – <i>quodam viro de Kendale debet xviijs</i>, Ripon (SS64/151); 1492 <i>Item that Kendale men that bryngeth wollen cloth to this Citie ... that they from hensforth sell in grose in theyre innes and loggyngs and by retaill in the said Thurseday market, and not to go hawkyng and sell in any other place</i> (YRS103/91); 1523 <i>Henry Hebbeson, Kendall man</i> (SS116/277); 1546 <i>aswell the inhabitantes of the said towne as Kendalmen and strangers</i>, Skipton (SS92/243). I suspect that ‘kendalman’ may have still been used as a by-name as late as 1550 when John Browne of Wakefield acknowledged a debt of 20s that he owed <i>vnto John Kendallman</i> (Th19/244). Wills provide evidence of the close links between Kendal and the growing textile towns in Yorkshire. In 1511, Richard Baines of Leeds referred to his <i>fermhold in Kendale</i> (Th1/98n); in 1517 Richard Fairbank of Halifax bequeathed 3s. 4d. to his<i>  fader at Kendall </i> and asked that masses be said <i> at a chappell in Kendall, as I was borne </i> (Clay44). In 1558, James Kitson of Wortley noted that money was owed to him by Robert and Rowland Brigges <i> of Kendall </i> (Th27/217) and in 1537 Thomas Stansfeld of Sowerby mentioned <i> xs. nowe in the handes of Thomas Wilson of Kendall </i> (Clay108). Several of these families were evidently closely related. In 1543, Richard Birkhede of Halifax spoke of his <i>costes to and fro to Kendall … four seuerall tymes</i> (Clay181): in 1538 William Holmes referred to relatives in Sedbergh and made bequests to <i> Henry Birkhed </i> of Halifax and his <i> god childe, doughter to Edmunde Farbanke  </i>(Clay116). The route followed by the merchants and their families was responsible for the place-name Kendalman’s Ford which is on the river Ribble, between Giggleswick and Settle. The river-crossing is shown on early maps and it is usual for local writers to describe it as ‘ancient’, without drawing attention to the significance of the term ‘kendalman’.

kidcote ,,,,,,,A regional word for a lock-up or prison.,"The OED has references in <i>c</i>.1515 and <i>c</i>.1540 to kidcotes in York and Bridlington. However, ‘kid’ has several meanings, including firewood and young goat, and the origin of the compound term is said to be uncertain. The editors speculated that it referred initially to one such gaol and was then transferred to others, as in the case of ‘bridewell’, and the eventual spread of the term across Yorkshire supports that view. In fact, kidcote has a much longer history in York, and at least two gaols in the city were so called: 1423 ‘the prison called the <i> woman kytcote </i> on Ouse Bridge’ (SS186/65); 1487 <i> Also I bewit xls to be disposed ... in meate and drynke emonge the prisoners of the castell and kytcottes in York </i> (SS53/29). These early spellings which have ‘kit’ as the prefix draw attention to another York reference from that century: 1482 <i> it was agreed ... that the said Brompton, Lent and Gyllmyn shold be set in the Kytton, thar to abyd to soch tym as it lyst the Counsell odyr wys to be awysid  </i>[advised]<i>  and farther to be punyshid apon thar beyryng </i> (YRS98/61). The inference may be that the original place in which prisoners were kept was a cote, a hovel fit only for harbouring an animal such as a cat. Or perhaps, since Kit was short for Katherine, from the early fourteenth century at least, suitable for harbouring women prisoners, as in 1423. The OED quotes: 1600 <i>Such foolish Kittes of such a skittish kinde, In Bridewell booke are euery where to finde</i>. </br>There are other early spellings with ‘kid’ as the prefix: 1430 <i>Et lego xxs ad emendum panem, cervisiam, et carnes bovinas et multonum dandas prisonariis in Castro Ebor. in les Kydcotes et in prisona domini Archiepiscopi Ebor., York</i> (SS30/8); 1450 <i>In mercede Radulphi Somer ... reparantium defectus fenestre camere et de le Kydcote per ij dies</i>, York (SS192/66).

Evidently, the Mayor and Sheriff each had his own prison or kidcote and the plural continued to be in frequent use: 1639 <i>To the poore prisoners in the Kidecoates</i>, York (YRS50/212). </br> It seems quite likely that the word originated in York and spread from there to other Yorkshire towns, ultimately also to neighbouring regions. Bridlington’s kidcote dates from before 1540 (OED) and there was also one in Pontefract about the same time: 1535 ‘for breaking the laudable customs of the said town the defendant commanded the plaintiff to be had to the <i>Kydcote</i> ... which is the place of imprisonment ... for such offenders' (YRS41/140). It seems that kidcotes came to be seen as municipal prisons, and eventually most towns felt they had a right to such a place. In 1728-9, for example, the principal inhabitants of Huddersfield presented a petition to the magistrates claiming they were <i>much infested and oppressed with vagrants</i>, so that the constable, <i>for want of a kidd coat or prison hath been obliged to charge persons to his aid in secureing ... such vagrants</i>. It was ordered that one be <i>built at the Expence of the Township and erected by the Constables</i> (QS10/16/29).

landing ,lending,,,,,,"A landing place, one where a boat might be drawn up.","It is comparatively rare as a vocabulary item: 1519 <i>Item that no man or woman dry no hempe in the dame, nor in the lendynges goynge to the dame</i>, Selby (SS85/32). In fact, the use of ‘landing’ as a place-name element is key to the history of the word, which features regularly along the Ouse in undated twelfth-century documents, for example <i>Sanct Martini Lending</i>, York (PNER292) and <i>Gatelending</i>, Selby (YRS10/102). Perhaps the earliest and most significant reference is in a Selby charter where <i>Cuarlendding</i> is probably a misreading of <i>Cnarlendyng</i> (YRS10/103); it occurs in 1320 as ‘<i>Knarlending</i> near <i>Seleby</i>’ (YRS94/63) and the prefix is interpreted by Smith as a word for a small warship. ‘Lending’ is ultimately of Scandinavian origin, and was formerly common along the Ouse and its tributaries. Notable examples are later associated with river ports: 1389 <i>Mildebylendyng</i>, Boroughbridge (SS120/38); 1392-3 <i>Draxlendyng</i> (HAH161); 1357 <i>Paradislendyng</i> (YAJ44/160). The last of these was in Hambleton, held by the abbot of Selby, and from there timber and underwood were conveyed by boat to the Ouse, along Selby dam. </br> It was also a common element in York: 1300 <i>Sywinlending</i> (YRS83/196); 1375 ‘a lane called the <i>Lymelending</i>, from North Strete to the river Ouse’ (SS186/9); 1398 ‘the lane called <i>Seintmartynlendyng</i> in <i>Conyngstrete</i>’ (YRS76/178); 1401 ‘the lane called <i>Fishelendyng’</i> (SS186/32). The latter is mentioned into the sixteenth-century when it is clearly defined: 1572-3 <i>a pece of waist grounde ligheng</i> … <i>at the east end of the north syde of Ouse brig commonly called the fysshe landyng; and he to make a sufficyent landing place and way for the fysshemongars there</i> (YRS115/62). A foot-note identifies this site as a little quay on the east end of Ouse Bridge. On the little river Foss, in 1427, was ‘the lane called<i> Sayntdinisselendyng’</i> (SS186/91), and Lendal Bridge marks the site of St Leonard’s Landing, where timber and stone for the fabric of the Minster were off-loaded. It occurs as a by-name in the poll tax returns: 1377 <i>de Thoma del Lendyng</i>, York (PTY). </br> A few place-names for which no early examples have come to light have the spelling ‘landing’, and further downstream, near to Selby, are the historic sites of Riccall Landing and Old Landing, traditionally seen as the place where the Scandinavian fleet was moored prior to the battle at Stamford Bridge. Wilfholme Landing is on the navigable river Hull and Free Landing is near Aldwark.  </br> In recorded history the ‘lendings’ were simply places where a boat might unload or take on cargo, not quays or staithes where the river bank would be reinforced by some sort of stone or wooden wall. In most cases the ‘landing’ was linked to the village further inland by a lane, as at Hemingbrough. The evidence implies that the first ‘lendings’ were disembarkation sites and they are associated with Scandinavians: it was comparatively late before ‘landing’ emerged as the modern spelling and shook off its links with river navigation. As a word for the ‘platform’ at the head of the stairs it is not on record before 1789 (OED) but in coal-mining a landing was a level place where coals might be loaded, sometimes a boarded area: 1715 <i>from the Landing Board to the Seat under the coals</i>, Farnley (MS14); 1840 <i>landing boards at Springfield Lane pit</i>, Tong (Mss4c/17). The verb ‘to land’ was also part of the miner’s vocabulary: 1754 <i>landing coals</i>, Beeston (DB129/4).

land-staithe  ,,,,,,,"The location of a bridge abutment, that is the structure which supported the bridge arch and linked it to the land.","1418 ‘the <i>landstathe</i> at the foot of the steps’, York (SS186/57). The contract for Catterick Bridge is in English throughout and more explicit, specifying that the proposed new bridge should be <i>of stane … in mason craft acordand in substance to Barnacastelle brigge, aftir the ground and the watyr acordes, of twa pilers, twa land stathes, and thre arches</i>. The land-staithe was later listed as part of the <i>tymbir werke</i> for which the builders were responsible, and this suggests that it was a kind of wooden platform for the masonry of the abutment (NRQS3/34). If that is correct it lay over the brandreth and piles. I have not found the word later than 1595, when £20 was charged <i>for amending of Catterick Bridge land stare</i> (NRQS3/33). The editor’s comment on this word was that the spelling reflected the local pronunciation of ‘staithe’, and this spelling can be compared with ‘land-stay’ below.

land-stall ,,,,,,,,"The OED has a single example of the word, noted in the North Riding Quarter Sessions for 1739, and the meaning given is ‘staithe or landing place’. However, the passage from which the example was taken implies that it had to do with with repairs carried out on two local bridges, almost certainly work on the abutments. ‘Land-stall’ can therefore be compared directly with ‘land-staithe’ above. An earlier and more explicit reference occurs in the contract for Apperley Bridge when it was replaced in 1602. The task of reconstruction was given to a mason called Thomas Wallimsley and he was required to provide <i>one good and sufficient stone bridge … containing … two Landstalles or heads … one piller and two archies</i> (BAS6/141). Thereafter, the word is found frequently in bridge accounts. In 1678, Lune Bridge, which carried traffic from Cumberland through to Durham via Yorkshire, was badly damaged by a flood which had undermined <i>the groundwork of the landstalls</i> (NRQS7/14): in 1706, changes were made to Cattall Bridge and <i>it was thought convenient by the County that both the Land Stalls at eather End should be raised for conveniency of making an easier assent and that it should not in any flood be unpassable</i> (QS1/45/4). These were evidently masonry abutments, since the workmen were <i>to Raise both with stone worke and Earth at both Ends and Pave it all Annew</i>. Similarly, in 1702, <i>the Landstalls</i> of a bridge over the River Laver near Ripon had <i>to be built of good and well wrought hewen stone, well bedded and sett in lime and sand</i> (QS1/40/4).",,BAS6/141,,1602,Apperley Bridge,NRQS7/14,,1678,Lune Bridge,QS1/45/4,,1706,Cattall Bridge,QS1/40/4,,1702,Ripon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
land-stay ,,,,,,,,"There are several examples of ‘stay’ as a form of ‘staithe’ in minor place-names. The <i>comon stay</i> in Bawtry (1567-76) was said by Smith to derive from an Old English word for ‘pool’ but it abutted on the River Idle and seems certain to have been the common staithe (PNWR1/48). Staithgate in North Bierley is known as Staygate locally and was formerly the way to the coal staithes. The word ‘land-stay’ appears frequently in connection with bridges about the time that ‘land-staithe’ occurred as ‘land stare’ (see above) and it seems to have replaced it. In the 1579 contract for the building of Elland Bridge this spelling occurred several times, most relevantly in a reference to <i>the foundations of the said jewels and landstayes</i> (HAS35). More explicitly, a report on the bridge at Conistone in Wharfedale in 1684 mentioned <i>the excessive charge of new Oake Timber of which they made Fraimes for Lying under the Pillers and Landstays</i> (QS1/23/8). The flood that destroyed Cam Gill Bridge in Kettlewell in 1686 left <i>part of the landstayes … standinge but in danger to be carried away by the violence of the streame</i> (QS1/26/1). Timber remained an important bridge-building material: 1708 <i>Charge of wood for the Landstays wearing</i>, Bolton Bridge (QS1/47/9) but no doubt parts of the abutments were already of stone.",,PNWR1/48,,1567-76,Bawtry,HAS35,,1579,Elland Bridge,QS1/23/8,,1684,Conistone in Wharfedale,QS1/26/1,,1686,Kettlewell,QS1/47/9,,1708,Bolton Bridge,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

law ,,,,,,,,"As a place-name suffix this derives from Old English <i>hlāw</i> and it referred in literary texts of that period to an artificial mound, one which marked the site of a burial or a place where treasure might be hidden (EPNE1/248). More generally it is said to have meant a mound or hill, possibly one that resembled a tumulus. It survived as a vocabulary item in the West Riding, certainly into the early seventeenth century, and it is employed there in boundary descriptions, where it referred to a pile of stones, a cairn that is. Such ‘laws’ were probably erected as boundary markers: 1532 <i>and so from that Meer to another Law of stones in Smolden</i>, Kildwick (MD335/2/3/9). In 1594, a marker on the boundary between Midgley and Wadsworth was described as <i>one heap of stones now called Sabile’s Law</i> (WYAS276) and the Ecclesall name Ringing Low was described in 1574 as <i>a great heape of stones called Ringinglawe</i> (PNWR1/200). </br> Not all the examples noted are so explicit. A Meltham indenture of 1571 mentions <i>one rode of land … lyinge on the west side the lawe</i> (G-A) and a Barkisland deed of 1611 has a parcel of land <i>under the Lawe att the Hystondelffe</i> (OWR2/1/36). Nevertheless, these almost certainly referred to heaps of stones that had been erected to serve as markers. As a small plan was drawn on the reverse of the Barkisland document we can clearly see what a ‘law’ looked like to our ancestors: it was a cairn.

lodge  ,,,,,,,"When lodge came into English from French it meant a hut, arbour or small house, a temporary building. It then came to be used of a keeper’s house in a deer park and this meaning survived into the seventeenth century at least.","A survey of Pickering Forest in 1619-21 noted that there were <i>no keepers lodges within any part of the foreste</i>, whereas in Blandsby Park there were two, <i>the upper and lower lodge</i> (NRR1/33). From the late 1400s, such lodges were being put to a variety of uses. In 1483, for example, Edward Gower was granted permission to <i>have low masses said in the house called le Loge in Beverley Park</i>: in 1489 there was <i>a mansion called le Loge</i> in Sheffield Park (CYS198,229). In <i>c</i>.1540, a dispute at the Court of Star Chamber had to do with such a lodge in the Forest of Galtres: </br><i>Sir Thomas Curwen seyeth thatt the seid howse, wheryn the seid defendauntes have allegged a wever to dwelle, was buylded and made only for a lodge for the keper of the seid  south parte of the seid foreste, for the sauegarde and mayntenaunce of the kynges dere or game there, and nott for eny wever to dwelle in. And also the seid cotage was buylded and made to kepe in the lyeme houndes of the seid keper</i>… (YRS41/87). </br> The word could also be used from that early period for the workplaces of masons, herdsmen and the like. In the fabric accounts for York Minster are: 1371 <i>Roberto de Ottelay operanti ibidem in logio per 41 sept</i>; 1399 <i>In le loge apud Ebor. in cimiterio lxix stanaxes</i>; 1409 <i>Item logium pro cementariis construendum</i> (SS35/6,17,200). Similarly, the fabric rolls of Ripon mention the <i>Mayson loge</i> in 1541-2 (SS81/194). Quite different types of lodge are found on the estates of the great abbeys: in 1366-7 Kirkstall Abbey had <i>in Crosdale ... vnum loghe pro pastoribus</i>, and the keeper or <i>custos</i> was <i>Willelmus del Loghe</i> (Th8/361). Fountains Abbey used the same word to describe specialist cattle-rearing establishments, referred to as <i>logias</i> as early as 1190-9 (SS67/9). A property they owned at Nutwith Cote in Masham is described in a lease of 1495 as a <i>graunge or loge</i> (SS42/324n) one of more than a dozen such places. More explicitly an abbey lease of 1537 described one of these at Bouthwaite as a <i>dare-house, loige and feahouse</i>, a farm therefore where dairy cattle were raised (SS42/279). </br> In a coal-mining context the lodge could be a temporary building at the pit mouth which might serve as a store and rest-place. A lease of 1597 granted Leonard Atkinson of Beeston <i>libertye to erecte and builde any Lodges over the said Coalepittes for … any the servants or workemen … and for takeinge downe of the said Lodges and carryeing away of the same in as large and ample Manner as is convenient and necessary</i> (DB129/4). It can be compared with ‘cabin’, ‘pit house’, and ‘shed’, used in other districts. </br>Some keepers’ lodges had already been converted into farms by the sixteenth century. In 1584, a survey of the manor of Idle contained a reference to a parcel of ground <i>within which there standeth a pretty Lodge, wherein sometime the keeper dwelt when deer was kept there</i> (BAS1/192). Others were rebuilt as country houses: 1651 <i>a fayre howse lately built knowne by the Name of the Lodg … which house conteyneth three severall Roomes below staires and as many above with a Court before the doore</i>. There were also two barns and a stable, <i>diverse litle yards</i> and a garden, all in good repair (NRR1/69). General Bernard who was related to the Beaumonts of Whitley used the word in 1793 as the name of a grand new mansion that he had built at Colne Bridge, calling it Heaton Lodge. In the basement, the domestic staff had a kitchen, pantry, shoe-room and larder; there was also a servants’ hall and special accommodation for the butler and house-keeper. On the ground floor were a dining-room, vestibule and central staircase, with private family bedrooms in both wings, each with its own dressing room: upstairs were seven guest bedrooms. A comprehensive range of outbuildings, included a hot-house, and shops or workplaces for a butcher and blacksmith. The name <i>Heaton Lodge</i> was clearly intended to highlight this magnificence: the irony is that a farm called Lodge just across the river had once been the keeper’s cottage in Mr Pilkington’s deer park. 'Lodge' would become a popular name for villa residences from that period.

The continuing use of such aliases through Elizabeth’s reign is a reflection of how unsure people were about the ‘correct usage’: 1564 <i>lyenge on the east syde of the hall and chappell of the scyte of the manor, or manor-place, or manor house of Manstone</i> (YRS50/113); 1566 <i>all that their manor or haule place called Baihalle</i>, Huddersfield (DD/R/4/3); 1587 <i>one capital mesuage or mansyon place callid Castelhall</i>, Mirfield (YDK13).",lake (4),Th9/9,,1650,Leeds,SS30/89,,1443,Sheriff Hutton,YRS83/99,,1448,Gomersal,SS106/26,,1532,Car Colston,DD203,,1533,Calton Hall,YRS50/113,,1564,Manstone,DD/R/4/3,,1566,Huddersfield,YDK13,,1587,Mirfield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mere (2) ,,,,,,,"In the West Riding ‘mere’ in the sense of boundary developed a related but quite distinct meaning, serving to identify a territory rather than a boundary.","Saddleworth and Holmfirth offer the most comprehensive evidence: Saddleworth was divided into four territories called Friar Mere, Lord’s Mere, Quick Mere and Shaw Mere but the only early reference noted is <i>Frear Meere</i> in 1468 (PNWR2/311). This may identify the ‘mere’ as the land in Saddleworth which belonged to Roche Abbey. In Holmfirth, another ‘forest’ territory, the subdivisions of the ‘graveship’ were also called ‘meres’, and here we have earlier examples, e.g. 1327 <i>Cartworthmere, Scholemere</i>; 1331 <i>Hepworthmere</i> (YRS109). Later these places would be described as ‘hamlets’ and later still as townships (HFPN30-1). </br>The element occurs also in Slaidburn where the earliest examples noted are <i>Knollesmere</i> in 1500 (PNWR6/207) and <i>Riston Meere</i> in 1551 (YRS2/158). At the Quarter Sessions in 1720 a causeway which passed over Bowland Knotts was said to belong to <i>three meers equally amongst them being all within one township</i>: they were named as <i>Rishton Grange Meer, Essington Meer</i> and <i>Hamerton Grange Meer</i> (QS1/59/1). Although Hammerton was actually a distinct place-name in the parish, recorded independently in 1086, it is possible that three of the territories identified connections with the local families named Hamerton, Knowles and Rishton alias Rushton. Rushton Hill in Easington may commemorate Rishton Grange Mere. </br> Similar references are found over a relatively wide area: 1317 <i>Carltonmere</i> in Royston (YRS78/184); 1539 <i>Soureby mere</i>, Halifax (WCR9/158); 1586 <i>Remyngton Meare</i> (YRS22/17) and 1590 <i>Thurlestone Meare</i> (YRS7/131). This use of ‘mere’ has not been explained satisfactorily. For example, the circumstances in which Thurlstone mere is recorded make it clear that it was actually a discrete area within Thurlstone township: David Hey described it as a subdivision of the township, possibly the name given to ‘the rough common pastures on the edge of the moors’, but he was unable to define its limits or exact meaning (Hey11). Stephen Moorhouse commented on the Holmfirth names, saying that this use of ‘mere’ represented an extension of the word’s meaning but he remained uncertain how to interpret it (WYAS266). </br>The earliest example in which this ‘extended’ meaning has been noted is in an undated thirteenth-century charter: this records a grant to Kirkstall Abbey by <i>Ernaldus filius Petri de Neuhale</i> [Newall in Bolling], of land which extended from an oak tree <i>juxta Sumerwell … ad diuisas de Birle et de Birlemere</i> (Th8/244). Domesday listed only <i>Birle</i> and it is possible that ‘mere’ in this case testifies to a subsequent parochial division of its territory. East Bierley and North Bierley are neighbours but the former became part of Birstall and the latter part of Bradford. The prefixes East and North have not been found before this reference to Birlemere and it means we cannot be certain which of the two Bierleys was the original settlement. </br>Similarly, Shelf was in the parish of Halifax but a part of it lay within the manor of Bradford and the term <i>Schelfemere</i> found in another early but undated document is probably an acknowledgement of that distinction (HM/D/135). In fact, the term was characteristic of Wakefield manor, for example: 1439 <i>Schypedene in Northowromemer</i> (YRS63/120). The distinction in this case was probably made because the lower part of Shibden was in Southowram.",,PNWR2/311,,1468,Saddleworth,YRS109,,1327,Holmfirth,PNWR6/207,,1500,Slaidburn,YRS2/158,,1551,Slaidburn,QS1/59/1,,1720,Bowland Knotts,YRS78/184,,1317,Royston,WCR9/158,,1539,Halifax, YRS22/17,,1586,Remington Mere,YRS7/131,,1590,Thurlestone Mere, Th8/244,,nd[1200-1299],Kirstall Abbey,HM/D/135,,nd,"Shelf, p.

The ‘mere stones’ referred to in these early documents will have been common features of the landscape and their locations are shown on some early maps. Although they marked important boundaries they could be removed and the Slaithwaite court roll of 1551 records an indictment against Thomas Hoyle for displacing the <i>merestones</i> which marked the boundary with his neighbours (DD/R/M).

merridew ,,,,,,,A name given to cows.,"1530 <i>to my cosyng ij oxen ... and ij kye named Meridew and Strange</i>, Felixkirk (YAJ22/204). The meaning poses a problem but it invites comparison with Merridew as a by-name and surname: 1379 <i>Johannes Meridewe</i> (PTWR). This has usually been linked with Welsh Meredith (R&W) but that seems an unlikely explanation for a Yorkshire surname in 1379 and it raises the possibility that merry-dew should be taken at face value. In fact it could quite easily be a development like that of merry-weather which was formerly an idiomatic phrase for pleasure or delight (Halliwell). Similarly Chaucer’s contemporary Gower described the sun as ‘merry’ in 1390 so it is not impossible that the dew glistening on the grass at sun-up was also seen as a happy augury. The strong associations around 1300 between ‘merry’ and favourable aspects of the weather, the climate, and even atmospheric conditions seem to make that possible.

messuage,messuage stead,mesuage,,,,,"Originally, the ‘messuage’ was a piece of land occupied, or intended to be occupied, as a site for a dwelling-house. Over the centuries the word then acquired new layers of meaning which reflected the individual histories of such properties.","Chaucer used it, and it is recorded as early as 1290 in an official document, after which it was employed regularly in title deeds. It may appear to be simply a synonym for dwelling house, but the messuage included outbuildings such as barns and cow-houses, and also any neighbouring lands that were traditionally associated with the dwelling. These were probably distinct from the ‘appurtenances’ of the messuage. In 1587, John Kaye’s share of a divided property was described as <i>the dwellinge howse, beynge the est end of the messuage</i> (YDK78). </br>Occasionally, such a property is described in detail, and the breadth of the meaning then becomes clear. For example, there is a document of 1564 entitled <i>A territorie or bondarie of one mesuage callid Moysey Hill</i>, a dwelling in the hamlet of Rowley near Huddersfield, and the survey consists of no fewer than twenty-six short paragraphs, in which the names of the enclosures and land that were deemed to be part of the messuage are given. They include <i>Knolgreave Close … Brodeynge … Swynes Croft … Tomrode … Armyteige … Ellys Acre</i> and <i>Gaverholme</i>, and <i>airable land at the north ende of the lane goynge to the Cowmes</i> (YDK57-8). The place-name Moysey Hill has not survived, but many of the fields can be identified on later maps and they allow us to locate its former site with some accuracy. </br>‘Messuage stead’ marked the site of a messuage, and can be compared with mese stead above: 1517 <i>two messuagez steddes and a tofte</i>, Threshfield (YRS140/62); 1546 <i>Lyonell Rolston, ij messuage steids with one kilnehouse, ijs iiijd</i>, Pontefract (SS92/277): in the same survey is a reminder of the word’s earliest meaning: 1546 <i>one mesuage stede not buylded upon</i>, Water Fryston (SS92/334).",,YDK78,,1587,Woodsome,YDK57-8,,1564,Huddersfield,YRS140/62,,1517,Threshfield,SS92/277,,1546,Pontefract,SS92/334,,1546,Water Fryston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

mire pit(s) ,,,,,,,These were pits in areas of marshy ground.,"The term is first noted in an undated thirteenth-century charter: <i>novem acras terræ … quam tenui de Willelmo Tosti … viz. totam terram quam habui ad Mirepittes et apud Norlangythemore</i>, Marton in Cleveland (SS89/23). The same word occurs much later: 1619-21 <i>And thence even suth till the mire pit in the slade … And sithne fra the mire pit even suth till the greene how</i>, Ruston (NRR1/24); 1657 <i>to make her fence sufficient att the upper end of John Beaumont Mierpittes</i>, South Crosland (WBR/2). On a map of Southowram and Rastrick, dated 1625, the place-name <i>Blackmyrepitts</i> was written in a steaner or oxbow of the Calder (DD/SR/10/218) and since ‘Carr Pit’ in Dalton and Nook Pitts in Linthwaite occur in similar locations, one possible inference is that these were places where alluvium or black earth was being extracted, in order to enrich land elsewhere in those townships; the practice can be compared with that of warping in lowland parishes. </br>It seems to be implicit in a number of documents which make no mention of the place-name. In Methley, for instance, which also adjoins the river Calder, tenants had a customary right of way to the <i>town Mires</i>, and two men were fined in 1516 because they failed to clean a ditch between the <i>Myers</i> and <i>Stener</i>, which again places the mires in an oxbow (Th35/195). In 1578, the ditch was described as lying between <i>Stenderfurth</i> and the <i>Towne myres</i> (Th35/220). </br>In 1755, the Revd Joseph Ismay of Mirfield wrote in his diary about agriculture in the parish, and included ‘black earth’ up to twelve feet in depth among the useful commodities found there. He was clearly aware of how deep the reserves were so there may have been pits where it was being extracted. In 1851, a Meltham carrier was paid for <i>8 loads of black earth from Meltham Moor</i> (WB1/1/146). The common minor place-names Black Mires and Black Pits may therefore be additional evidence of upland ‘warping’: 1570-1 ‘in the same field in a place called <i>black pitts</i>', Kilnhurst (TWH16/128).",town mires,SS89/23,,nd,Marton in Cleveland,NRR1/24,,1619-21,Ruston,WBR/2,,1657,South Crosland,DD/SR/10/218,,1625,Southowram,Raistrick,,Th35/195,1516,Methley,,Th35/220,1578,WB1/1/146,,1851,Meltham,TWH16/128,,1570-1,Kilnhurst,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mirk ,murk,,,,,,,"The use of this as an adjective has been associated with Scotland more than with England, and in the sense of dark in colour it is said to be rare (OED).

moldbrest ,,,,,,,,"I have found no explanation of this word in the OED or in specialist glossaries but it occurs in one or two fourteenth-century court rolls for the manor of Wakefield: 1327 ‘land lying unoccupied at Horbury called <i>Molebrist</i>’ (YRS109/125); 1338 ‘<i>6d.</i> for leave to take an acre lying <i>molbrist</i> on the lord’, Hipperholme; 1340 ‘eight acres in Holne <i>…  </i>lies <i>moldbrest</i> for lack of tenants’, Holme (WCR12). These occur in translated passages but in each case the clerk used the regional term in the Latin text. The word ‘brest’ could mean ‘damaged’ so perhaps this was a reference to ‘mould’, that is good land, which was deemed to be ‘spoilt’ because it lay uncultivated. In the notes of the Yorkshire antiquary Roger Dodsworth is a passage from the same court rolls which relates to land in Ossett. The extract is dated 1346 but will have been translated by him in the first half of the seventeenth century: <i>The jurors say ... that the custome is here that although any land lye fresh and unmanured whilest distresse can be found in herbage or meadow belonging to the same that the sayd land shall not be accompted for Moldebrest yet they say that there was there neither Herbage nor meadow where a distresse for the Lord’s farme might be made.

moordike ,,,,,,,,"In <i>The Harvest of the Hills</i> (2000) Angus Winchester wrote of ways in which the upland landscape of the north reflects centuries of land management. He described the physical division between the cultivated lower areas and the unenclosed moorland, sometimes still to be seen as a bank and ditch running across the hillside. This had a variety of names, including ‘acredyke’ in some regions and ‘head-dyke’ in others. In fact, townships at different altitudes had unenclosed areas of waste called moors and another word for such a boundary, in different parts of Yorkshire, was ‘moor dyke’. The term has been noted in Durham in 1579 (OED) but the Yorkshire evidence takes its history back to the thirteenth century, in an undated deed: n.d. ‘extended in length from <i>Moredik</i> on the north to <i>Catdikes</i> towards the south’, Kilnwick (YRS7/105). Similarly, in 1315-6, a selion in Church Fenton lay ‘next <i>le Muredike</i>’ (YRS69/51) and in 1399-1400, two strips of arable land in Swaledale were said to lie between <i>le Muredyke</i> and the river (YRS102/94). The bursars’ books of Fountains Abbey record a payment of 6s 8d in 1457-8 <i>in factura sepium circa Mordyke apud Chapelhous</i> (SS130/55) and at a very low altitude Everthorpe in the East Riding had <i>le Muredyke</i> in 1521 (YRS39/68).",acredike,OED,,1579,Durham,YRS7/105,,nd,Kilnwick,YRS69/51,,1315-6,Church Fenton,YRS102/94,,1399-1400,Swaledale,SS130/55,,1457-8,Fountains Abbey,YRS39/68,,1521,Everthorpe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

moor gate  ,,,,,,,,"The term ‘moor gate’ can have three quite different meanings. It was quite commonly a 'gate’ which could be opened and shut, controlling access between land under cultivation and the moor beyond, and in this sense the word occurs frequently in manorial records. In 1734, for example, the inhabitants of Lund in the East Riding were ordered at the local court to <i>make their moor fences good</i> and not <i>leave the moor gate open</i> (YRS69/99). Similar references are found throughout the 1600s, including <i>the more yeate</i> in Malham in 1604 (DD/Ma) and <i>the moore yate</i> in Ardsley in 1666: in this latter case payment was made for <i>a crooke and loope</i> which would fasten the gate (D/16/5/1). The initial ‘y’ in such examples makes it clear that ‘gate’ was the sense intended. </br> On the other hand it seems likely that in some very early documents ‘gate’ had its origin in the Scandinavian word <i>gata</i> meaning ‘road’, and the ‘moor gate’ was the way to the moor from the village. That was probably true of <i>Le Moregate</i> in Wadworth near Tickhill, mentioned in 1323 (YRS85/174), and of <i>le Moregate</i> in Owsthorpe noted in 1341 (YAJ17/107). In both cases land was said to abut on <i>le Moregate</i>. It certainly had that meaning in some compound minor place-names: <i>c</i>.1300 <i>prope venellum qui vocatur Mynstermorgate</i>, Beverley (SS89/446). </br> However, in some  ‘moor gates’ the gate was neither a road nor a gate but a right of pasturage: 1724 <i>70 acres of arable land ... 30 mooregates or depasturing for 30 beasts to goe and depasture on the freehold moore</i>, Norton le Clay (MD87).",gate (2),YRS69/99,,1734,Lund,DD/Ma,,1604,Malham,D/16/5/1,,1666,Ardsley,YRS85/174,,1323,Wadworth near Tickhill,YAJ17/107,,1341,Owsthorpe,SS89/446,,c.1300,Beverley,MD87,,1724,Norton le Clay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

moss (2)  ,turf-moss,,,,,,"A swamp or morass, a peat-bog."," These were common landscape features, and ‘moss’ is a frequent element in northern place-names from the twelfth century.

Of equal interest are Moss Hagg, Mossy Sikes, Mosley Mires and two ‘Moss Crops’, the last of these from a word applied to various species of cotton-grass. It was a popular generic also, and <i> Blakmosse </i> was recorded in 1205-11 (PNWR7/226). Typical moorland names in this category include Fleet Moss, Holme Moss and the more evocative Featherbed Moss which occurs in Bradfield, Grassington, Meltham and Saddleworth. </br> The mosses were a source of peat, and responsible for a number of distinctive vocabulary items, especially ‘moss room’, not listed in the OED. This was a division in a ‘common’ moss, and it gave a tenant the right to extract peat and turf: 1556 <i> Item towrves oppon the mosse xiijs iiijd, </i> Kirkham, Lancashire (SS26/92). In 1684 William Pennington’s property in Whittington included <i> one Mosse room </i> (EG42) and the term is implicit in a Rathmell lease of 1664. This granted land to Henry Walmsley on Rathmell Moor <i> reserving to Henry Clarke a parcel  of Mosse being in the East end thereof as the same is marked and meared and staked forth for diging, getting, graveing and drying of peates, turves and fuell in the said Mosse </i> (MD217).

mystery ,,,,,,,," The York cutlers described their craft as a ‘mystery’ and an order in 1477 allowed <i> eny maister apprentez or servant to wirke in the said misterie by candel light </i> under certain conditions (SS120/133). In 1565 the ordinances of Sheffield’s cutlers spoke of <i> the cutler occupacion </i> and <i> cuttelers craft </i> (HCC1) whereas that had changed in 1590 to <i> the mystery or crafte of a Cutler </i> and <i> the said science or crafte </i> (HCC2). This was ‘mystery’ as the word was used in the medieval trade guilds, derived from Latin <i> ministerium,  </i>and meaning ‘craft’ or ‘trade’: the noun ‘mister’ was in use from the thirteenth century, comparable with French ‘métier’. There was almost certainly some confusion with ‘master’ and ‘mastery’, and also with ‘mystery’ in the sense of secret ceremonies which had an identical spelling but different origin. That may be implicit in article 4 of the Sheffield Orders which employs the plural of the word, referring to <i> personnes usinge … the said mysteryes or scyence </i> (HCC2). If the term ‘little mesters’ has a long enough history it may have been influenced by that confusion.

oak ,,,,,,,,"England’s most popular tree over the centuries, responsible for hundreds of place-names, many of them recorded in Domesday Book. Typical examples include Ackworth, Acomb, Oakenshaw and Oakworth, all of Old English origin, whilst Aketon and Aikwood have spellings which testify to Scandinavian influence. Solitary oaks were boundary markers and meeting places, as in Shire Oaks and Skyrack. Scores of minor settlements have survived with simpler names, such as The Oak in Sowerby and Oakes in Almondbury. The oak was our major source of timber in the past and it is referred to countless times in wood leases and wood management documents: 1316-7 <i>Pro j quercu et j rota molendini empt(is) apud Ryther pro domo in Holdernesse</i> (YRS154/425); 1470 <i>Johanni Rawdon de Wystow … pro xlv quercubus 4li</i>, York (SS35/73); 1599-1600 <i>Oke Tymber trees Super le Wham Hagg</i>, Settrington (YRS126/29). A Dissolution survey of the woods that had belonged to Fountains Abbey divided oaks into several categories: 1574 <i>Okes of the best sorte </i>were valued at 13s 4d<i> a pice; of the second sorte</i> at 6s 8d; <i>of the third sort</i> at 3s 4d and <i>speres of okes</i> at 12d (SS42/412). The historian T.D. Whitaker offered an insight into how fashion changed when he said of English oak in 1816 that it had traditionally ‘formed the great material of our furniture as well as of our floors and roofs’, but then added that it ‘was a stubborn log, dark and unsightly; and as soon as the first plank of mahogany’ was imported from Jamaica, people ‘began to discard the lumber of their dwellings and to adopt the new material’ (Whit1/80).

offal ,,,,,,," This word has become more specific in meaning over the centuries, and for many people now it signifies those parts of a butchered animal which remain when the carcass has been dressed, i.e. the kidneys, heart, tongue and liver."," It is said to have passed into English from the Dutch <i>afval</i>, literally the ‘off-fall’, that which has fallen off, and its wide range of early meanings included wood or leather that was not of the first quality: 1547 <i>all the topes, loppes, barkkes and offall</i>, South Crosland (WBD2/44); 1577 <i>certen old planks and other offall of wood 6s 8d</i>, Beverley (YRS84/9); 1580 <i>and also the offall of all the said trees, viz so much … as wilbe no tymbre</i>, Thurstonland (YDK77).

This was defined in a Quarter Sessions document of 1736 as <i>pieces of leather called offolds of cows’ hides ... the least useful scraps </i>(QS1). A tannery in Keldgate, Beverley which specialised in the early 1900s in the processing of bellies and shoulders was known locally as <i>the Offal Yard</i> (BTT15).<i> </br></i>The meaning was not ‘waste’ or ‘superfluous’, but simply ‘not of the first quality’, for in every early instance the offal was being put to good use. That was still the case in Henry Best’s advice on bee-keeping in 1642. He recommended that after the honey had been extracted, water should be put into a tub - <i>for every hive 3 gallons of water, for every hive’s offell will serve to sweeten 3 gallons, </i>Elmswell (DW70).  Presumably the ‘offal’ in this case referred to bits of the comb that had broken off as the honey was being extracted. The liquid would then be used to make mead.

oliver  ,,,,,,,"The ‘oliver’ was a tilt hammer, used by early iron-workers."," The OED evidence for the word is limited to nineteenth-century quotations, the first dated 1846, although a reference to a description of the ‘contrivance’ indicates that it was in use in 1686. The first Yorkshire examples are in Warley near Halifax, in 1350 (WCR2/260), and Creskeld in Arthington in 1352. In that year Richard de Goldesburghe leased two ‘olivers’ to a man called Robert Totte; supplying him with charcoal and iron ore which is confirmation that Totte was operating a smithy. The original deed is in French and relevant extracts include: <i>deuz Olyveres contenaunz vynt quatre blomes</i> and <i>urre suffisaunt pur les ditz Olyvers</i> (Th41/302). The inference is that ‘oliver’ had already come to be used of the site of the hammer, of the smithies itself, a development similar to that of ‘wheel’. Stephen Moorhouse notes the use of <i>olyvers</i> in Clayton West in 1418, and more specifically in the Wakefield area: 1479 <i>le smethys called Olyver</i>, Crigglestone (WYAS775). In sixteenth-century accounts for the smithies at Farnley near Leeds the building which housed the hammer was known as the ‘Oliver’: 1582 <i>Paid to the smethe men for scouring and trimming the Olyver and mending the great dame 14s 4d: Item for theakine the olyver 10s 8d</i>: ‘theakine’ or theaking describes repairs to the roof (Th41/304). The etymology of ‘oliver’ remains uncertain but it has been plausibly suggested that the hammer in early forges may have been named in honour of the legendary hero Oliver who was renowned for the mighty blows he struck in battle. There is one possible reference in the Sheffield area: 1637 <i>Item a meadow Called ye Oliver</i>, Ecclesfield (HSMS280) where the inference is that an ‘oliver’ had once been in use there.

osier hope ,,,,,,,"The osier was a type of willow and it had tough pliant branches which once had a variety of uses, especially in basket-work: the word came to be applied more generally to willows and to the branches themselves."," ‘Osier hope’ is a rare term, recorded in the OED under ‘hope’: 1607 <i>I have planted an Ozier hope … in a surrounded ground, fit before for no vse, for the too much moisture and overflowing of it.</i> It was said to be a word found also in Essex and can be compared with osier holt and osier bed. Two Yorkshire examples are from roughly the same period: 1615 <i>lez Eightes, Les Osier hopes, vineyards, willow trees, Lez wares, mildames & Fludgates,</i> Almondbury (DD/R/dd/2/27); 1623 <i>all messuages … eightes, les osiers, hopps, fishwandes, sallowes, the weares, mildames, rundells</i>, Butterwick (NRQS4/159). I believe the punctuation in this transcribed indenture masks the second example of ‘osier hope’, and since ‘eightes’ were aits or small islands it seems clear that willows were being coppiced in enclosed, marshy areas by the river or possibly on small islands. Halliwell described ‘ait’ as a little island where osiers grow.

osmund ,,,,,,,," It is known that Sheffield cutlers were using iron and steel imported from other countries from the sixteenth century at least, and much of it came via Danzig (FBH184). In fact iron had been imported into Yorkshire from a much earlier date and the key to that is in the word ‘osmund’ which has an uncertain origin but referred initially to high quality iron from Sweden: the term later came to be used more generally for iron from a number of countries, imported via the Baltic. It was imported as small bars or rods and the OED notes examples from 1280, with one for Hull in 1400-12. In York a case in 1428 against John <i>Lyllyng</i> proved that he had forged <i>fals osmundes</i> by mixing tin and lead: <i>William Kyam saw ij barells of osmundes market</i> with John Lilling’s mark (SS85/2). The published customs accounts for Hull contain numerous references, starting with a cargo from Danzig brought in the <i>Jacob</i>: 1453 <i>1 last’ osmondes</i> (YRS144/3): an editorial note says that a ‘last’ was 12 barrels of osmunds.

outset  ,,,,,,,,"In October, 1664 a group of tenants from the manor of Wakefield raised what they considered to be a case of discrimination within their own community. They were described as <i>the Inhabitants of the out-setts of the hamlett of Linley </i>(WCR5/139) which was then part of the vast township of Quarmby, so the inference is that <i>out-setts</i> is a reference to their outlying locations, away from the nucleus of houses in Lindley. That origin may be shared by two Derbyshire places named Outseats which date from 1566 and 1683 respectively (PNDb156,189). In Harrison’s survey of Sheffield manor, in 1637, a tenant called William Hincliffe was said to hold <i>at will a Cottage being an out sett adjoyneing to the East side of Alsoppe Farme house in Sheffeild Towne</i> (HSMS69), possibly a comment on its status although the meaning in this case is obscure.

outshot ,outshut,,,,,,,"  The first dictionary evidence for this word is a Yorkshire example of 1624, so it is likely to be a regional term. The outshot was an extension built onto the side or rear of an existing building and the suffix describes the projection thus made. References occur commonly from the first part of the sixteenth century: 1533 <i>buyld … one house to have two outshittes </i>[sic]<i> at either ende</i>, Halifax (Clay89); 1538 <i>2 outshoits joined to a new house lately of William Waddesworth</i>, Sowerby (WCR9/44); 1542 <i>le Owteshott near the cemetery</i>, Huddersfield (DD/R/dd/2/6). Two of these spellings clearly point to the influence of dialect on ‘shoot’ as the suffix. </br>The frequency of the word in those years may imply that building such extensions was only then becoming popular in that part of Yorkshire, and a variety of almost explanatory examples have been noted subsequently: 1594 <i>one messuage, one owtshott adjoined and affixed to the said messuage</i>, Kirkheaton (WBD/3/72); 1666 <i>in the Outshoote joining to the Kill</i>, Brayton (YRS47/75). In the seventeenth century the spelling ‘outshut’ became more frequent and the term was increasingly taken as a synonym of ‘eyling’: 1604 <i>one eling or outshutt adjoining the said bay</i>, Hopton (YRS39/92); 1640 <i>a house and barn and le Outshutt or Eelinge adjoining</i>, Holme (WCR1/25).

packhorse bridge  ,,,,,,,,"For centuries, and certainly into the early nineteenth century, goods were transported by packhorses, occasionally in ‘gangs’ of 18 or more but perhaps more usually in small groups. They followed customary tracks and roads, up hill and down dale, crossing numerous rivers and streams en route, and yet there is no entry in the OED for the term ‘pack-horse bridge’. It has been used frequently enough by transport historians in recent years, as when W.B. Crump wrote about ‘causeys’ and claimed that they ‘originated, along with the pack-horse bridges, in the sixteenth century’ (Crump31). Now, any bridge that is old and narrow and has a single arch is likely to find itself described as a packhorse bridge. There were alternative words: bridlesty bridge was recorded in 1688 (QS1/27/1) and ‘horse bridge’ was quite frequent from the late sixteenth century. In 1598, the West Riding magistrates ordered the inhabitants of Trumfleet and Thorpe to <i>make the horse bridge sufficient between trumfleete Marshe and thorpe Marshe … upon payne of xls </i>(YRS3/129). The context suggests that this may have been a causeway, but the term occurs in all three Ridings after that date and some of the bridges so described seem likely to have been what we now call packhorse bridges. ‘Evill-slack bridge’ in Skelton near York was also a ‘horse bridge’ in 1606 (NRQS1/35). A later word was ‘pack and prime bridge’, recorded in 1798 but probably much older, since the term ’pack and prime way’ is on record from 1628.

painted cloth ,,,,,,,," In the Tudor period the walls of wealthy families were hung with tapestries, partly for ornament but also no doubt to exclude draughts. We are less familiar with the term ‘painted cloths’, items which may have been a cheaper substitute but served a similar function: the images often had a religious theme. They feature in many inventories from the fifteenth century: 1485 <i>xij yerdis of panetyd clothes ijs viijd</i>, York (SS45/302) but the term is recorded earlier in Latin: 1392 <i>lego ... meliorem pannum meum pictatum</i>, York (SS4/173). Such items were among goods imported from Veere in the Low Countries: 1483 <i>3 pannis depictis £1</i>; 1490 <i>a dos’ pantyd clothys</i>, Hull (YRS144/196,203). They were also used in churches: 1498 <i>Item ij awterclothes peynted price iijs</i>, Wakefield: these were recorded in the chantry chapel on the bridge (YAJ15/93). </br> Some references provide us with details of the paintings, as in the inventory of the goods in St William’s Chapel on Ouse Bridge: 1509 <i>ij curtyns longyng to the hie alter of rede payntid damaske wark ... ij alter clothes and ij curtyns of white damaske flowers payntid … ij olde alter clothes payntid with rede and ij curtyns for the werk day</i>, York (YRS106/29-30).

pampilion  ,,,,,,,,"The OED gives two meanings for ‘pampilion’, the first as a word for fur, although ultimately derived from an unidentified animal. This is on record from the fifteenth century when it was characteristically used for trimming garments. The second meaning offered is that it was the name of a coarse woollen fabric, possibly derived from one or other of two similar place-names in France and Spain. The evidence in this case dates from 1567. A definition offered by John Brierley, a cloth frizzer in Wakefield in 1761, throws light on its later meaning: </br> <i>A sort of hair cloath called pompilion in Yorkshire itt is made of that cow hair wich comes of salted hides. Itt is a sort of strong stapled hair and free from lime or dirt but calf hair has the finest staple to make cloath. Cloath on pompilion is made like wadding and is used for to lay shear boards with all in Yorkshire </i>(YRS155/101). </br> It was actually a traditional material in the West Riding and some of the points made by John Brearley appear in a much earlier reference. In 1538 complaints were made by a number of Wakefield men that <i>dyvers persons byeth nawtte herre of the tannerrs and sells it to Cendell men to blende it with woile and make cloth of it called pawmpillzon cloth </i>(WCR9/86). The complainants were saddlers who were objecting to hawkers selling <i>unlawfull ledder</i> so the inference may be that ‘pampilion’ was being used in some of the products, perhaps as wadding in saddles, although saddles were not actually mentioned. It seems possible though that ‘animal hair’ in these references may link the two quite distinct meanings offered in the OED. </br> That is not the first reference to this word in Yorkshire sources for it occurs as the specific element in a minor place-name more than two centuries earlier: <i>Pampellion Holme</i> was an enclosure held by the Earl of Surrey in 1316, located in Thornes which formed part of Wakefield parish (YRS63/15). It is explained by Smith as deriving from a nickname but I find no evidence for such a name locally. However, examples occur in other counties, notably in East Anglia: 1310 <i>John Pampiloun</i>, Suffolk (R&W); 1381 <i>William and John Pamphilonn</i>, High Easter in Essex (PT). This does not clear up the origin of the word which must be sought much earlier than has been thought.

pannierman ,,,,,,," In theory this word might refer to any hawker or tradesman who carried his wares in panniers, but in Yorkshire it was used principally of fishmongers who operated from the eastern half of the county."," Panniers were said in <i>c</i>.1300 to be made ‘to beren fish inne’ (OED) and the early link between fishermen and panniermen is clear-cut: in 1467 traders in Beverley were referred to as <i>piscarii viz. panzaremen</i>; that is fishermen or panniermen (BTD58): in 1468 <i>Ricardus Pannyerman, fisher</i> was granted the right to trade in York (SS96/188). The link with east-coast fishing towns was often specific: 1476 <i>de Thoma Webster de Sywardby </i>[Sewerby],<i> Fisher alias panyerman</i>, York (YHB24); 1553 <i>William Storie, Skardburghe, panyerman</i> (YRS11/169); 1558 <i>John Storrie, Bridlington, panyer man</i> (YRS14/155). In fact ‘pannierman’ as a by-name survived over several centuries: 1301 <i>de Thoma le Paynerman</i>, Skelton (YRS21/37); 1486-7 <i>Elizabeth Ricardby, wife of Thomas Panyerman of Filey</i> (YRS103/3). In 1522, the will of a prosperous merchant called Robert Skyrley cancelled the debts of <i>Robert Panyerman, </i>and this is almost certainly a reference to his occupation and not a surname (SS79/154).  Throughout much of that period the men who were selling the fish had probably caught them also. </br>The emergence of the pannierman as a middleman may be implicit in that relationship between Robert Skyrley and Robert Panyerman, and it is explicit in 1583 when reference was made to licences granted to panniermen <i>to buy and Carye fish from the sea syde contrary to the Custome</i> (NRR1/251). These panniermen may not have been fishermen but the two occupations had strong family links. The saying ‘Mock no panyer-men your father was a fisher’ dates to before 1678 (EDD), and a study of family names along the coast points to such connections much earlier. John Skirlay of Hornsea Beck <i>fyscherman</i> died in 1512 (YRS6/151) and William Skyrlay of Hornesebek, <i>fyschmonger</i> in 1503 (YRS6/152): they seem certain to have belonged to the same family as the merchant Robert Skyrley, mentioned above who left lands <i>at Hornsebeke</i> to his son in his will. There are similar links in the Storry family. </br>From that time therefore, the panniermen were small merchants who met incoming fishermen at the coast and purchased their catch. They loaded the fish into panniers on the backs of horses and then made their way inland, to major markets across the region (EDD). In a Starchamber case in 1534 the plaintiff Robert Goldsborough stated ‘that he was a fishmonger as well for the … town of Pontefract’ as for other market towns and ‘Commonly every market day he conveyed fresh fish from the sea to Pontefract and brought it into the market place to sell’ (YRS41/140).

The word was used also at Spurn and along Yorkshire’s east coast for pools left by unusually high tides (EDD). Where it occurs in the place-names Pant Head (Austwick) and Pant Foot (Ingleton), it seems likely to have had the Cumbrian meaning.

park ,,,,,,,," The word has a French origin and was brought here by the Normans. It is now associated with recreational facilities and industrial complexes but it was originally an enclosed tract of land reserved for beasts of the chase, and held by royal grant. It was distinct from a ‘forest’, not least because it was enclosed by a deer-proof pale, and Blansby Park which lies within Pickering Forest is an example of that distinction. The place-name Blansby is evidence of a Scandinavian settlement but in the Domesday survey it already had the status of a ‘berewick’, as a demesne farm attached to Pickering. That relationship continued after the Conquest, when the castle was built and the surrounding district converted into Royal Forest. A memorandum in the records of the Duchy of Lancaster notes that<i> A Parke taken out of a Forrest may ly within and bee surrounded by the Forrest … and yet be no part of the forest</i> (NRR1/94). Blansby was probably a separate reserve from the early twelfth century, and an inquisition of 1251-2 details its links with Pickering, touching on the customs and rights that tenants had in the Forest in the time of King John: it was expressly stated that the <i>haya de Blaundeby</i>, that is the territory within the enclosure, did not belong to the manor, and the men of Pickering were not even allowed ‘housbote’ there. It is referred to as <i>le Parkes de Blandesby</i> in a petition in the reign of Henry III (NRR3/242) and an extent of the king’s lands in Pickering in 1297-8 listed ‘the park of <i>Blaundebi</i>’, with agistment worth 100s p.a. and meadow 40s (YRS31/73). Income from what was essentially a deer park clearly included profits from the sale of hay and grazing rights for live-stock. </br>Parks remained a landscape feature for centuries and are regularly mentioned in manorial documents: 1584 <i>a few old doted trees which are good for nothing except it be for the fire, which underwood and old doted trees do grow within her Majesty’s park of Almonburie</i> (MS205); 1599 <i>all that great Close of land Wood and pasture Commonlye called Roydes hall parke ... parcel of the landes belongeinge to the Capitall Messuage called Rodes hall</i>, North Bierley (MM/A/249).

Treacle or golden syrup was an essential ingredient and references to its use date from the early 1700s.

In 1602 the mason Thomas Wallimsley was hired to build <i>one good and sufficient stone bridge at Apperley</i> and he agreed <i>to pave and battle all the said bridge throughout</i> (BAS6/141). When Wetherby Bridge was in need of repair in 1614 the townsmen alluded to <i>the decay of the pavement … with the continuall travell of cole waines over the same </i>(YRS54/17). Similarly it was claimed in Birstall in 1706 that <i>great quantities of Lyme in wagons Excessively loaded </i>[had]<i> much impaired the paveing</i> (QS1) and at Cottingley, in 1683, men were instructed <i>to fill up all the holes in the pavement </i>(QS1). The approaches to bridges, causeways across marshland, and riverside stathes also required paving and from an early date testators contributed towards their upkeep.

In 1711 William Storr listed the dues payable to the archbishop: <i>Fines for a messuage, head of a whole oxgang, penny place, cottage, penny land, penny ings</i> (YAJ7/55).

pig-iron ,pig-metal,,,,,, Pig-iron is produced in a furnace by smelting iron ore with a high-carbon fuel: charcoal was used in earlier centuries and then later coke. The molten iron thus produced is run off into rough moulds where it solidifies and forms ‘pigs’., The first reference to pig-iron in the OED is in 1665 and the term was used in a south Yorkshire document in 1676. The accounts of Colne Bridge Forge contain entries in 1745 for <i>Barnby Piggs</i>; that is pig-iron brought over from Barnby Furnace (SpSt). In that state it contains impurities and is brittle; unsuitable for making edge tools. It can be converted into cast iron by remelting and blowing air into the molten mass. The Cutlers’ Company had strict rules about the use of pig iron and cast iron but their records show that these were not always observed: 1779 <i>Resolved that all suspicious places shall be searched for Forks made of pig metal</i>. Two cutlers called Parker were later suspected of producing ‘deceitful wares’ and the Company’s searchers found metal forks in their warehouse <i>made of pig iron or cast metal </i>(HCC24).,cast iron; shoat; sow,SpSt,,,Colne Bridge,HCC24,,1779,Sheffield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1745,
pike (1),piked,,,,,,," Said to mean ‘pointed’ in the place-names Pike Law and Pike Low, both recorded by Smith three times and both having<i> hl?w </i>as the suffix. The ‘law’ could refer to a hill or burial mound but in Yorkshire it was also used of boundary cairns in the Middle English period. Since so few of the Pennine hills are pointed it prompts me to suggest that ‘piked law’ meant a hill which had a pointed heap of stones rather than a pointed hill. In a description of the bounds of Gisburn Forest in 1205-11 the line ran <i>usque ad Pykcros super Manebent</i> (YRS87/31). A map of common lands in Ingleborough, dated 1619, places <i>The Pyke aboue Hamerton folde</i> on the hill called Moughton which is undoubtedly rocky but not pointed, often described as a limestone plateau (MPC235). The pointed symbol on the map almost certainly identifies a prominent boundary cairn. Some of the earliest examples of the compound Pike Law are in charters relating to the lands held by Kirkstall Abbey, notably those for the period 1329-33 which define the boundaries between Blackburnshire and Barnoldswick, for example <i>de Oxgille vsque Pikedlawe que vocatur Aleynsete</i>. This was hilly country, even if the hills were not ‘pointed’, but the same cannot be said for the low-lying land between Alwoodley and Chapel Allerton near Leeds which is mentioned in an undated charter: <i>vnam acram terre in campo de Alretun, iuxta Pikedlawe</i> (Th8/105,326). The two names are part of a substantial corpus of similar names which includes several Pike Hills and Pikedaws: the latter has the suffix <i>haugr</i> which is the Old Norse equivalent of <i>hl?w </i>and it was also commonly used as a boundary marker.",howe; pike (3),YRS87/31,,,Gisburn Forest,MPC235,,1619,Ingleborough,Th8/105,,1329-33,Kirkstall Abbey,Th8/326,,nd,Chapel Allerton near Leeds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1205-11,

In 1522 Robert Skyrley of Scarborough made the following bequest: <i>and to v men that goys in my bote, every oon of them a pilche</i> (SS79/154). These were presumably coarse garments suitable for hard work at sea, and the inference may be that they were made of cowhide or sheepskin.

pit eye ,,,,,,,," Few examples of this term have been noted in reference works and the only quotation in the OED is for 1881 where it is explained as ‘the bottom of the shaft’. It has a much longer history than that: 1574 <i>when they dryve owte of the eye</i>, Sheffield (SYC3); 1690 <i>parte of pitt eye coale getting</i>, Farnley (MS11). The same term was used by miners of ironstone and lead: 1630 <i>1 pickman or hewer will require 1 carrier from him to the neyt or eye pit, there one winds it up</i>, Derbyshire (R&J68). In fact it was an alternative word for ‘pit’ in ironstone-mining: 1576 <i>one Pitt or Myne called One eye of Iron Stone</i>, Farnley (BM82/15). The inference is likely to be that in shallow pits the ‘eye’ marked the place where daylight gave way to darkness, although few of the references are detailed enough for that to be evident: 1706 <i>framed the fallen pitt eye</i>, Farnley (MS11); 1714 <i>from the old pitt eye</i>, Shibden (HAS30). </br> At times it is as though the ‘eye’ was the whole shaft. It should be quite distinct from the ‘pit mouth’ which was the pit head but the two are on occasion used confusingly as apparent synonyms: 1754 <i>to lay, dispose and place on such part of the said demised premises as shall be near to the mouth or eye of the pit</i>, Beeston (DB129/9); 1806 <i>about eight yards from the eye or mouth of the pit</i>, Horsforth (SpSt/5/2/7).

They could be called on to serve more than one term but there is no obvious pattern to the appointments.

pit-hill ,coal-pit hill,,,,,," In the more recent history of coal-mining the pit-hill was the mound of waste close to the pit-head, of little value perhaps but scratched over for small pieces of coal in hard times."," Sixty and seventy years ago such pit-hills were a common sight and they provided exciting play-grounds for youngsters. The Rev. Lewthwaite wrote an account of Newsome (near Almondbury) in the church magazine in the 1880s and said of the hamlet of <i>Coalpit Hill</i> that <i>… a stranger might very reasonably ask why should this place be called by such an incongruous name … neither coals, coal-mines, neither banksmen nor tips may be seen now … still if we skip backwards 100 years or more these were all to be found on Coal Pit Hill. Then indeed there were no houses and coal getting was the principal thing.</i> </br> There was an attempt in many pits, certainly from  the eighteenth century to get rid of the waste and restore the land to its former condition: 1767 <i>2 men one horse and Cart one day removing the Hill</i>, Tong (Mss4c/10); 1777 <i>at the end of the said term remove and carry away … all the Pitt Hills, scale, stones, wood, gravel, earth and rubbish … and make the soil and surface … as level arable and good in every respect,</i> Southowram (HM/C/10). </br> In an alternative, earlier use the pit-hill was a hill or mound of coal close to the pit-head, where it would be stacked ready for sale, a valuable resource. In 1647 Adam Eyre wrote in his diary: <i>we parted at the Coyle-pitt hills</i>, Thurlstone (SS65/54): in 1672 a man was indicted at the West Riding Quarter Sessions for carrying <i>away certain Coales from the Coale pitt hill,</i> and in Bradford in 1702 <i>a collier at Mr Rawson’s pitt came to the pitt hill of Mr Edward Stanhope and gave the colliers their notice</i> (QS1).

In the accounts for a colliery in Farnley near Leeds payment is recorded in 1718 for a <i>Holeing pott</i>; that is probably for driving a tunnel or ventilation hole: a <i>Wake pott</i> in 1691 is less easy to explain since ‘wake’ had a variety of meanings which included festivals and funerals. As there was also a <i>Wake supper</i> it may have been for a holiday (MS11,MS14). A Shibden reference to the marking out of a new pit contains rather more information: 1713 ‘all the colliers assembled and Mr Lister allowed them a ‘sod pot’ of two shillings with which to celebrate the occasion; that is the cutting of the first sods as the ground was opened up’ (HAS30/147).

pudding ,,,,,,, As a plural noun the puddings were the entrails.," 1556 <i>that neyther man nor woman frome hensfurthe washe anye clothes, woole, puddynges ... in the waver,</i> Wakefield (YRS74/22); 1632 <i>A paine laid that noe man woman or child shall wash any puddings Fish Cloathes or any other filthy thing above the washing stone, </i>Burton Agnes (YRS74/90). </br> The washed stomach or entrail of an animal was used to hold mixtures of minced meat, oatmeal, suet and seasoning which were then boiled to produce dishes that were called puddings. Henry Best’s servants were fed such preparations: 1642 <i>Wee sende for the folkes puddings a bushell of barley, but neaver use any Rye for puddings because it maketh them soe soft that they runne aboute the platters</i>, Elmswell (DW109). The research of Peter Brears has introduced us to many varieties of pudding, for example, <i>Herbe-Pudding</i> and <i>Kidney Puddings</i> in 1683; <i>Carrot Pudding</i> in 1735 and <i>Colliflower Pudding</i> in 1741 (GWK79-85). The meaning of pudding has expanded over the centuries, reflecting developments in food preparation. </br> Pudding was actually a common by-name from the early twelfth century (R&W). In 1275 <i>Johannes Pudding</i> played an active role in a serious affray at Stainland (YRS29/73) and in 1301, 3s 4d tax was paid at <i>Lythe cum Sandesend ... de Willelmo Puddinge</i> (YRS21/45). It was also a common first element in minor place-names, linked with –bag, –dike, –hall, –hill and –poke. Smith listed the names but in most cases offered no meaning: John Field suggested convincingly that <i>Puddyngholm </i>in Cambridgeshire (1438) was a reference to ‘soft, sticky land’, presumably having in mind the consistency of a soft, boiled pudding, not one of the early savoury puddings. That interpretation might also apply to place-names with a similar generic, such as –acre, –field, –hole, –mead, –meadow and –patch, but it cannot explain ‘Pudding Bag’ or ‘Pudding Poke’. The latter is the most popular combination in Yorkshire and it is surely a name for an enclosure which resembled a pudding bag or poke, perhaps an allusion to the shape and tiny point of entry. It is worth noting that in some dialects the wren and the long-tailed tit have ‘pudding poke’ as a nickname, almost certainly because of the shape of their nests.

This word, along with a  local variant spelling, occurs in the masons’ contract for the rebuilding of Catterick Bridge in 1422: one of the clauses granted the masons <i>free entre and issue … to the qwerelle of Rysedale berkes, </i>and then, using the alternative regional form,<i> to the wherelle of Sedbury </i>(NRQS3/34). The two spelling were used in minor place-names such as Quarry Hill, Almondbury: 1634 <i>Wharrel alias Querrellhill</i> (DD/R/3/14) and Quarry Gap near Bradford: 1693 <i>Quarrell gapp</i> (DBB/5/C12). When Mr Armytage was building or repairing Kirklees Hall, in 1609, he wrote to Mr Beaumont of Whitley Hall saying that he was <i>destitute of much stone</i> and desired <i>such like as your quarrell affordeth</i> (WBC/32). ‘Quarrel’ survived as a dialect word but it is interesting to note that in 1672 a Quarter Sessions clerk crossed out the final ‘ll’ in the words <i>John Blackburn’s quarrell</i> and substituted the letter ‘y’ (QS1). The diarist Abraham Shackleton of Keighley wrote in 1794 that he <i>helped to delve at the wharls</i> - a spelling almost identical with one in Westmorland in the EDD where a reference to a quarry was qualified with the words ‘or wharle as we call it’ (1825).",,YRS69/126,,,Ilkley,YRS102/92,,1316,Richmond,PTWR,,1379,Sherburn in Elmet,NRQS3,,1422,Catterick,SS81/153,,1425,Ripon,Th57/25,,1500,Leeds,YRS161/36,,1581,Stockeld,NRQS3/34,,1422,Catterick Bridge,DD/R/3/14,,1634,Almondbury,DBB/5/C12,,1693,Bradford,WBC/32,,1609,Kirklees,QS1,,1672,np,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,c.1290,

Hall said in a footnote that <i>a qwell was a spring of water</i>; that is a ‘well’. He was aware that names and words which begin with ‘w’ were locally given an initial ‘q’ by clerks who were reporting what they heard, but I believe that his interpretation was mistaken and that ‘qwell’ in this instance was a spelling of ‘wheel’. It can be compared with spellings of spinning-wheel above, and the surname Wheelwright in the following example: 1379 Richard <i>Qwelwryght</i>, Halton West (PTWR). The testator’s reference to the <i>qwell which stands in Porter Felde Side</i> is confirmation that the reference was to a building which housed a grinding wheel.

rail (1),railway,,,,,,," These words are first on record in coal-mining districts, in connection with ways or roads laid with rails which allowed heavily-laden wagons to move more freely.

It was described as <i>a bridge over A deep Houll ditch</i> and was actually called <i>Houll Becke Bridge</i>. A petition by local people for its repair is lengthy and full of terrifying details.

rake ,,,,,,,"It had two closely related meanings, referring firstly to a rough path in hilly country and secondly to a pasture ground used by sheep and cattle."," The dual meaning seems likely to have developed as access to hill-pasture along such tracks became customary: 1564 <i>in and about the sheppe Raikes or paithes</i>, Rawdon (YRS114/101); 1598 <i>had stint and rake of goodes</i> [stock] <i>in Fountans Fell in the Abbey tyme and since</i> (YRS114/164); 1688 <i>a rent for a catlerake over Raskelfe Common</i> (NRQS7/277). From the Tudor period the use of ‘rake’ as a pasture was well established: 1520 <i>binds himself ... to keep a wether flock ... on such raykkes and grounds</i>, Darnbrook (YRS140/47); 1664 <i>all that flockraike or sheep pastures</i>, Hanlith (MD217). </br>Almost inevitably the word became a common element in minor place-names: 1495-6 ‘from which a payment of 26s 8d to Lord Scropp is mad ann. for <i>le Cowrake</i>’, Pott (FAR4); 1536 <i>to pay an out-rent ... of 26s 8d for a cow pasture now named the Cowe Rake</i>, Pott (YRS140/301). In fact Cow Rake became quite a frequent place-name: 1641 <i>present ... a Slingsby yeoman for an assault ... at a place called le Cow Raikes</i> (NRQS4/212). Two additional examples are Cow Rakes Lane in Whiston and Cowrakes in Lindley near Huddersfield (PNWR8/45). </br>The use of ‘rake’ as a verb with the meaning ‘to pasture’, especially to pasture illegally, is recorded from the seventeenth century: 1617 ‘the cattle might <i>rake over</i> into the disputed ground but they were not herded there’, Oakworth (BAS8/8); 1661 <i>and lette his sheepe rake over all theire oats sowne on this south-side of the sayd heads</i>, Cottam (DW221). It was used also when permission was granted for red deer to feed on moorland in Swaledale: 1653 <i>quietly to leap, rake, depasture and lodge on the premises,</i> Healaugh (NYRO31/21). </br>The Cottam reference above to animals straying onto land sown with oats is evidence that ‘rake’ was not confined to upland areas but could also be used of pasturing or pasture rights on lowland farms: <i>c</i>.1624 <i>a sheep rake in Cottam Field for eighteen score sheep £6,</i> Elmswell (DW218). Of course this right could be exercised only after the harvest had been taken in, and there is similar evidence in a sequence of deeds for Hanlith in Malhamdale: 1662-76 <i>winter stint or raike ... the edige and winter raike within the open fields of Hanleith ... herbage and feeding for the said beasts to raike, feed and depasture </i>(MD217). </br>None of the above evidence touches on the earliest use of the word in Yorkshire and for that the only information we have is in by-names and place-names.  In the accounts of Bolton Priory, for example, are entries which make it clear that as early as the fourteenth century ‘rake’ was used not of a path but of a territory, probably one used as pasture: 1311 <i>Pro assartacione in le Rakes vjs</i>; 1314 <i>Pro fossura apud le Rakes iiijs jd</i> (YRS154/293,365). This is likely to have been an area of waste or common in Halton East for <i>le Rak’</i> featured there in a priory rental of 1538 (YRS132/30). Even earlier is a by-name in the Calder Valley, also in the plural: 1275 <i>Adam del Holirakes</i>; 1376 <i>Johannes de Holinrake</i> (GRDict383).

Similarly, in 1538, Leland stated that <i>Most of the Coale that be occupied about the Quartars of Richemount Toune be fetched from Rayle Pitts toward … Akeland</i> (YAJ10/476) and such references are confirmation that ‘Rale’ was a place. One editor suggested that the coal was brought south from Relly near Durham but it seems more likely that it came from Railey in the same county.

ramper,rampier,rampire,,,,,,"These archaic forms of ‘rampart’ appear to have two distinct meanings in connection with bridges. In the first, the word was used of a reinforced river embankment, and there is a descriptive reference in the repairs to Kettlewell Bridge: 1686 <i>the rampier on the south end to extend 20 yards in length up the water and to be carried 12 yards in length below the bridge; and that on the north end to bee 12 yards in length on each side</i> (QS1/26/1). The rampire may originally have been the earth embankment itself but in such cases it was clearly the wing or wing wall of the bridge.

ratton bread,,,,,,, ‘Ratton’ was the regional word for a rat.," It derives from Old French <i>ratoun</i> and its use dates from <i>c.</i>1300 (OED).

ratton row,,,,,,," ‘Ratton Row’ is a minor place-name which occurs so frequently across the north of England that it is tempting to see it as a generic, applied to any row of houses or cottages which was rat infested or perhaps just run down."," One possible Yorkshire example occurred in Swaledale in 1297-8 (YRS31/80) but the earliest confirmed reference in the county is in a list which had to do with property in the Mirfield area, that is: 1405-6 <i>Nethirholes, Brygelone, Ratunrawe, Whitleghes</i> (WBD12/4). Not long afterwards it was the name of buildings in York, mentioned in a lease of 1420-1 which placed a garden ‘between the tenements of <i>Ratonrawe</i> and the stone wall of the city’ (SS186/59). </br>A locality with the same name is mentioned in the will of Humphrey Waterhouse in 1545 when he bequeathed to his son Laurence <i>all the meases in Hallifax called Ratton Rawe </i>(Crossley8): there is no doubt that this was by then an established place-name and references in the court rolls include: 1574 ‘one house or cottage in a place called Rattonrow in Halifax’ (HAS37/106). The Halifax historian John Watson said it was a very ancient name and wrote in 1775 <i>Rattan-row is the name of some ground adjoining to the church-yard, on the north side … where the fair was kept. </i> </br>The inference in this case may be that the Halifax name had survived the demolition of the old buildings on the site but the truth is that some references, even from an early period, were not to bricks and mortar: in 1553 for example ‘half an acre of pasture called <i>Ratton Rawe</i> in Etton’ was in the tenure of John Anleby (ERAS24/60). Other East Riding examples noted are: 1667 <i>an hous in Rattan Row</i>, Bridlington (BCP273); 1772 <i>Ratten Row</i>, Kilham (DD147). From the sixteenth century ‘row’ had begun to replace ‘raw’ as the suffix, as in Leeds: 1578 ‘my other cottages … in a place called <i>Ratten Rowe</i> (Th1/109): in the parish register it was <i>the Rattanrawe</i> in 1580 (PR). Many of the latest examples are in villages rather than in towns, that is in Dodworth, Garsdale, Lepton, Long Preston, Swillington and Thruscross, already recorded by Smith (PNWR8). However, the list does not end there, for example: 1736 <i>A Large well built House, opens two ways, to Westgate and to Ratton Row in Wakefield</i> (Th24/100); 1777 <i>Charles Utley, hucster … at Rattenrow in Addingham</i> (PR). If these were genuinely late they suggest that the term had become part of a common regional vocabulary. </br>The area nationally in which ‘Ratton Row’ can be found has not yet been clearly defined but it occurs in many northern counties and with earlier references. Three Cumberland examples have been recorded, starting with 1410<i> Rattanrawe</i>, Arlecdon (PNCu337) whilst <i>Ratteonrawelane</i> is listed among ‘lost’ Kendal street-names, found between 1575 and 1620 (PNWe1/118). In 1633 Rattenrow was one of several commons in the Redesdale ‘marches’ of Northumberland (AW32). In Nottinghamshire the county town had <i>Ratounrowe</i> as early as 1308 (PNNt16) and John Markham held a toft in <i>Rattenraw</i> in East Markham in 1513 (YRS55/174). No examples have yet been noted in Derbyshire. </br>Whilst the etymology is clear enough the interpretation remains a matter for conjecture. The editors say of the Nottingham place-name that it was ‘a common nickname of contempt in medieval street-names’ whilst Diana Whaley said of Ratten Row in Caldbeck that it was a ‘semi-jocular name for a dismal row of dwellings’. The late examples and the use of the word for areas of common and pasture may point to a more complicated meaning and its use as a generic.",,YRS31/80,,,Swaledale,WBD12/4,,1405-6,Mirfield,SS186/59,,1420-1,York,Crossley8,,1545,Halifax,HAS37/106,,1574,Halifax,ERAS24/60,,1553,Etton,BCP273,,1667,Bridlington,DD147,,1772,Kilham,Th1/109,,1578,Leeds,PR,,1580,Leeds,Th24/100,,1736,Wakefield,PR,,1777,Addingham,,,,PNCu337,1410,Arlecdon,,,,,,,,,,,,,1297-8,

razormaker,razorsmith,razor grinder,razor hafter,,,,," In 1285 <i>William le Rasorer</i> was a tenant of Wakefield manor, living at Thornes (YRS29/195), and it is possible that he made razors. Otherwise the first mention of the occupational term is in Rotherham, more than two centuries before it has been noted in Sheffield: 1459 <i>John Dolfyn, rasursmyth</i>, Rotherham (YRS111/144). Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that Sheffield cutlers were making razors long before it became recognised there as a specialist occupation. In 1681, for example, the Cutlers’ Company presented Sir John Reresby and his clerk with six razors, two of them with silver caps, in recognition of their help in the fight against the hearth tax, and in the same year John Greaves was described as a <i>razormaker</i> (FBH129). References in the Sheffield parish register increase from the early eighteenth century: 1709 <i>Thomas Wilson, Razorsmith</i> (PR7/33); 1710 <i>John Slack Rasor smith</i> (PR7/37); 1721 <i>Thomas Betts, razorsmith</i> (PR6/134).

Specialist razor grinders are on record from the 1700s and not just in Sheffield: 1786 <i>Samuel Knot of Ackworth, Razor Grinder</i>, Wragby (PR); 1786 <i>Joseph Turnpenney of</i> … <i>Birstall, Razeor Grinder</i>, Hartshead (PR).

reap,,,,,,, As a noun it dates from the Old English period and can mean ‘bundle’ or ‘sheaf’. In Yorkshire it is much used with reference to bundles of peas from the seventeenth century.," 1642 <i>Pease pullers … break the stalkes, cutte the stalkes, or else pull them up by the rootes, and then … they rowle them on forwards, tumbling them over and over till they bee as many as they thinke sufficient for a reape</i>, Elmswell (DW60); 1671 <i>reaps of fitches lapt within some reaps of pease</i>, Tinsley (QS1/11/1); 1677 <i>there was many reapes of cleane pease whereas George Bollers land was throughout struck with wild oates or thistles</i>, Barnsley (QS1/16/10). No connection has been established with ‘reap’ as a minor place-name which occurs several times in the Pennines, especially near woodland or on the moor edge. The earliest evidence for this word is in Heptonstall: 1578 <i>Henry Bawmefurth surrendered a parcel of land taken from the waste containing forty-three acres and three roods called parcel of the Reapes</i> (HAS37/141). Reap Hirst in Huddersfield dates from 1658 (HPN118) and Reaps in Slaithwaite from 1710 (SLPN28). The meaning remains uncertain although it has been suggested that it referred to ‘shrubs, brushwood’ (PNWR7/235). The meaning here may also be bundles or sheaves, marking locations where moorland plants such as ling were formerly harvested.

rear ,raise (2),,,,,,"To set up or erect a building, originally bringing the main trusses of a timber-framed house into a vertical position."," R.W. Brunskill defines different aspects of the task in Timber Building in Britain (1985) with diagrams on p. 45 which show successive stages of the process and the number of men involved. Early documentary references are quite rare: 1583 <i>John Hanson ... 36 years ago did know certain buildings in the town ... at the setting up of which</i> [he] <i>was a helper to rear or set up the same amongst other neighbours,</i> Huddersfield (DD/R/2/16); 1678 <i>for twoe Timber trees for Parsonage barne ... for bringing them from Yestrop parke ... to 4 carpenters 4 dayes worke apece ... in ale at the rearinge the timber</i>, Pickering (YAJ35/414). Completing the rearing was clearly a cause for celebration, and a good excuse for ale-drinking: not surprisingly the custom outlived the timber-framed house and became associated with completing work on the roof of a house, whatever materials it was made of. In 1776 workmen in Meltham had ale supplied at four different stages, ending up with <i>rearing – meat for workmen</i> (G-A). In 1796 a North Riding farmer recorded a visit to friends, saying <i>They had a supper about the rearing of their new house </i>(WM34) and in Mirfield in 1818 William Carr provided <i>a bottle of rum </i>and <i>a Shoulder of Mutton for the rearing supper </i>(DD/CA/5).

In 1491, for example, the cordwainers paid <i>xiijs iiijd to have ther old ordynaunces agayn delivered with serche of blake and rede lether</i>, York (YRS103/74) and in 1546 it was <i>agreyd that the cordyners shall bring to my Lord Mayer ther graunts whiche they have for licence to serche red ledder</i>, York (YRS106/143). The York cobblers’ ordinances of 1582 stated that they must mend only <i>old bootes with read leather … and not with blacke leather </i>(YRS119/60). Evidently the distinction between the two had to do with more than just the colour. Nevertheless it seems safe to assume that tanned leather was dyed red using a colouring agent, possibly the ‘rouch’ referred to above in 1476. If this is a spelling of French ‘rouge’ it may have been a solution in which there was iron oxide, although natural red dyes from plants and insects had long been used on textile fibre: kermes or grains was a scarlet dyestuff brought into Hull: 1490 <i>½ dos’ graynes</i> (YRS144/204). In the Act of 1558 it was said that<i> tanned leather red and unwrought </i>should be sold only<i> in open fair or market </i>(SAL7/137) and by the Act of 1662 persons buying <i>any red tanned leather within the city of London or three miles thereof</i> were required to give notice of their purchase <i>to one or more of the company of curriers</i> (SAL8/70).

rein ,rain(e),ran(e),rayn(e),,,,"A narrow piece of land, although the precise meaning has varied from one district to another and even from one parish to another."," Several writers commented on the word in the nineteenth century, among them Joseph Lucas in Studies in Nidderdale (1872): ‘the country is covered with little step-like terraces called ‘raines’ ... each being twenty or thirty yards long and two or three yards wide’, the feature that is which landscape historians call lynchets. These strips are now under grass but are said by some to have been arable formerly: 1517 <i>two acres of lande ... lying est and west of either side a rayn,</i> Threshfield (YRS140/?); 1607 <i>Henry Deane for getting gress in the Raines in the Field,</i> Kirkby Malham (DD/Ma); 1748 <i>four rains called Cross Green or Cross Green Lands in Malham East</i> (MD217). In 1894 Canon Atkinson wrote: I made oral inquiries in Wensleydale about ‘reins’ ... the grass headland ... all round a field was the answer I got. Then ... terraces on a hillside, like steps on a stair. The other day they were grassy banks ... between the arable steps’ (NRR1/61/n). In fact different shades of meaning are implicit in early records: in some south Pennine townships the word referred to thin strips of woodland where fields dropped steeply down to a stream: 1519 <i>all the wodes within the birke stubyng except a reyne in the north syde, </i>Tong (Mss3/3); 1611<i> one little reyne of spring wood of small value, </i>Almondbury  (DD/R/dd/v/29); 1704 <i>And all Reines belonging and usually fallen with the same</i>, Bradley (SpSt); 1739 <i>To the Pillars when pilled the Reign instead of making mares</i> [meres, i.e boundary markers] <i>3s 6d</i>, Whitley (WBE/1/12). It survives as the minor place-name Reinwood in both Lindley and Horsforth. In other contexts its meaning overlapped with ‘hedge’: 1608 <i>followinge a certaine rayne or hedge devydinge Gomersall and Liversedge</i> (Peel); 1676 <i>set his nett at the end of a reine or hedge</i>, Sprotborough (QS1/15). </br>However, even in those regions where ‘rein’ was used of wooded strips of land or hillside lynchets, it was also part of the open field vocabulary: 1517 <i>also two half-acres of lande callyd Grenehowbuttes lying est and west of either side of a rane ... one acre called Gosepittes lying north and sowth emongest raynes</i>, Threshfield (YRS140/62) 1609 <i>all the common or waste grounds or soyle commonly called balks and reanes situate in the Biredolefeilds of Wibsey </i>(LRS2/160). </br>The evidence of minor place-names takes its history back to the twelfth century, although some of the references are undated: <i>c.</i>1192 <i>septem acras terre ... ad Cumbedenerane ... et ad Henganderane et ad Goditrane et ad Hermitrane</i>, North Stainley (YRS102/185); 1300 ‘three acres at <i>Henryran</i>, two acres at <i>Ryflatte</i> ... one acre and one rood at <i>Doweranes</i>, Bishopton (YRS102/18); 1481 <i>veridi bosco crescente plantatum vulgariter vocatum le call raynes</i>, Ripon (SS64/340). </br>The diversity of the spellings in these names, and the varied meanings, may be a reflection of the word’s complex etymology, for Smith lists his examples under two distinct headwords, that is <i>rein</i> and *<i>r?n</i>, the former Old Norse in origin and the latter Old English. The meaning given is ‘boundary strip’ in both cases. They are, he said, ‘often indistinguishable’ (PNWR7/235).

In this sense it was a ‘space’ occupied or left vacant: 1700 <i>recommending your son ... as theire representative in Parliament in the room of Mr Fleming</i>, Castle Howard (CSS13). In fact it was used in many contexts where ‘space’ or ‘place’ was the meaning: 1538 <i>one rowme in the xxvj stall apon the sowthe sid of the middist alley within the said chirch of Halifax</i> (Clay116); 1564-5 <i>to sett and plant vj yonge trees ... and if any dye to sett ... so many other of the like ... kynde in their roome</i>, Hemsworth (YRS63/51). More particularly it was used of the ‘compartments’ in structures such as piers and fish garths, recorded as <i>rowmes</i> as early as 1394 (YRS64/xvii).

room,,,,,,,-2," An undated thirteenth-century charter for Worsbrough has a reference to ‘two assarts (<i>essarta</i>) called <i>Rokelay stubbing</i> and <i>Rockelay Roum’ </i>(YRS39/183) and in the latter the use of ‘room’ as a place-name element is sufficiently rare to deserve comment. The context suggests that the meaning is ‘cleared space’, roughly equivalent to ‘stubbing’, and it is additional evidence that the word was an active vocabulary item. This name has apparently not survived but it may share the same origin as the Morley place-name ‘Rooms’ which also dates from the thirteenth century. In 1202 Adam <i>de Beston</i> purchased lands in the township which included an assart lying <i>inter le Ruhm et domum Adæ filij Hugonis </i>(SS94/32): Smith gave the meaning as ‘an open space, a clearing’ (PNWR2/183). Later in the deed there is mention of forty acres of land <i>in le Ruhm</i>, so the name can be seen to emphasise how spacious or expansive the initial clearance had been. Almost incidentally it suggests an alternative meaning for the local surname Room(e) which flourished for several centuries in the Beeston and Morley area. It had previously been considered to derive from Rome in Italy, as a name given to pilgrims (GRDict).",,YRS39/183,,,Worsbrough,SS94/32,,1202,np,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nd[1200-1299],

ruck,,,,,,," A heap or pile, as of stones, turf or hay, a word found in several glossaries."," Canon Atkinson defined ‘rook, ruck’, as ‘a carefully made heap, of no great size; of turves, stone, etc’. Isolated examples illustrate its use in the everyday vocabulary: 1577 <i>vj rookes of peise strawe vs</i>, South Cave (Kaner97); 1590 <i>2 lytle ruckes of hay</i>, Marske (YRS152/289) but it occurs more commonly in traditional boundary descriptions: 1637 <i>unto one howe called Cooke Howe and from thence to one rooke of stoanes in Arnesgill heade and soe to one rooke of stones above Hew Hill Brow</i>, Bilsdale Kirkham (NYRO23/1); 1642 <i>to a great Ruck of Stones aboue Stainedale Farm</i>, Helmsley (HRD433). In fact it has a much longer history in such contexts: 1294 <i>et abinde usque locum vocatum rukke super Cockhowe et deinde sicut aqua cæli dividit, </i>Marske in Swaledale (YAJ6/218). It is likely therefore to be the first element in place-names such as Rookstones in Rishworth, listed by Smith but with no explanation (PNWR3/48) and there are others where it may be preferable to ‘rook’ meaning the bird. It seems as though ‘ruck of stones’ was the original expression but that ‘ruck’ could be used on its own when the sense was clear. </br>Its use for stacks of turf or peat, both used as fuel, may have something to do with its early history in Nottinghamshire, where it was used of a particular measure of coals, possibly a pile of a certain size originally. The movement of miners from one coalfield to another may explain its later use in south Yorkshire. It is found there as a measure in colliery records from the early eighteenth century: 1729-31 <i>three Rooks or Stacks being two Dozen Of Coals; Colliers shall get the Coals at 18d per ruck; thirty Corfs to each Ruck</i>, Swillington (CKY37-8).",ruckle,Kaner97,,,South Cave,YRS152/289,,1590,Marske,NYRO23/1,,1637,Bilsdale Kirkham,HRD433,,1642,Helmsley,YAJ6/218,,1294,Marske in Swaledale,PNWR3/48,,nd,Rishworth,CK37-8,,1729-31,Swillington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1577,

It was applied in particular to travelling drapers, hawkers and pedlars of scotch cloth who called regularly at out-of-the-way places: they are said to have been successful partly because they used a credit system. The term occurs regularly in Yorkshire records from the seventeenth century: 1705 <i>Alexander Miller … and another Scotchman taken up with a pack on his back</i>, Gisburn (QS1/44/4); 1721 <i>Mary Hanson had bought the musling of one Robert Maxfield a Scotchman</i> (QS1/60/1); 1731 <i>William Rowan, scotchman pedlar</i>, Sheffield (PR); 1738 <i>one piece of red and white printed linen which she saith she exchanged with a Scotch Man for her son’s hair in 1736, </i>West Riding (QS1/77/6).

The inference may be that ‘sem’ derives from the word for ‘nail’ or ‘rivet’, on record in the most northerly counties and especially in Scotland.

sea-coal ,,,,,,, This early word for ‘coal’ has been explained in a variety of ways but one important theory is that it first described coal which had been cast ashore from seams exposed on the sea bed.," The diarist Abraham de la Pryme knew that coal was obtained in this way on the Yorkshire coast, and he wrote in 1697 of great quantities washed up in Holderness. It was, he said, little more than dust, <i>so exceeding small that it commonly smothers all their fires out, unless they keep perpetualy blowing the same</i>. In towns along the coast the people therefore had special chimneys, and set their houses in positions which ensured a constant draught (SS54/166).  </br> The main alternative theory is that sea-coal was so named because for many people it was literally brought to them by sea, especially from Newcastle upon Tyne. Oliver Heywood wrote in 1665 of an <i>exceeding scarcity of sea-coal in great towns that have been supplied from New-castle, especially London, Hul and York by reason that the Hollanders lye upon the sea-coast and hinder passage</i> (OH3/92). Neither explanation seems entirely satisfactory, especially if we consider that sea-coal was the name given to coal dug out of the ground in the Pennines as early as the thirteenth century. In Old English, sea-coal or <i>sæcol</i> was actually jet, also cast up on the east coast, and this may have been an influence when it became necessary to distinguish between charcoal and mineral coal. Most early references are in Latin: 1306 ‘and he is digging sea coal (<i>carbones maris</i>) therein, damages 6s 8d’, Sandal (YRS36/59); 1446-58 <i>Et petit pro labore suo ad carbon. marin. per iij dies, vjd</i>, Fountains Abbey (SS130/174).

seal  ,sele,seyled,,,,,To fasten a cow in its stall.," The origin appears to be an Old English word for a rope, although in Sheffield in the nineteenth century it was ‘a piece of wood put round a cow’s neck’ which was then fastened to a chain in the cow house (EDD). The verb is recorded from the sixteenth century and appears to have been confined to Scotland and the northern counties. In <i>c</i>.1570 Mr Kaye of Woodsome Hall advised his son that at certain times cattle and sheep should not be allowed into the pasture grounds: he was to <i>sele them upp to brede … mucke</i> (KayeCP). In 1682, part of a property in Monk Bretton was described as a <i>house for sealinge their cowes in and roome over them for lying of hay for the said cowes </i>(DD116b). A very similar description in the Huddersfield will of Richard Williamson, in 1686, referred to part of the barn and <i>mistell … sufficient to seale one cow and lay hay </i>for it (BIA/VR/478). Later, the word may have been used more generally, for Joseph Exley of Rawdon had geese <i>to sele</i> in 1740 (QS1). The buildings at Esholt Priory were surveyed in 1538 and they included <i>a cowe-house of iiij rowmys seyled abowte, </i>but this was perhaps for ‘ceiled’ (YAJ9/322).

seentree,signtree,sinetree,,,,,"In Wright the ‘sign-tree’ or ‘sine-tree’ is explained firstly as ‘one of the principal timbers of a roof’, and secondly as the ‘centerings of an arch’ (EDD)."," The word was in use in both Lancashire and Yorkshire. As no examples are quoted, either there or in the OED, the following references to its use as a roof timber are of interest. In 1817 a Slaithwaite diarist called Hirst wrote of damage to the ‘thack’ or roof of his house: he had been awakened in the middle of the night by a very loud noise and discovered that <i>the sine tree</i> [had] <i>slipped out of the mortis in the balk end</i> (KX390). In 1686 the accounts for the building of an extension to a house in Conistone mention <i>Fower paire of finetrees </i>[sic for sinetrees] <i>bought of … John Piccard’</i> (RW33). In this case the dimensions of the timbers are given as <i>10 inches deep and 5 inches in thicknesse</i>. In 1739 <i>1 pair of signtrees</i> at Lofthouse measured <i>10 fot</i> and cost one shilling (QS1/80/1). </br> The following references support the idea that ‘sine-tree’ and ‘sign-tree’ share the same origin as ‘centre’. For example, <i>signetrees</i> were required for the arches of Elland Bridge in 1579 (BAS6/139) and in 1698 <i>one paire of senters</i> referred to timbers for Pickering tithe barn (YAJ35/221). In 1747, <i>sintrees</i> for Clapham church bridge were listed in the same context as the frame and the arch (QS1/86/5). The semantic change can perhaps be explained by the fact that both meanings carry the idea of ‘load-bearing timbers’, and the orthographic connection may be via the word ‘tree’, commonly used in the past instead of ‘wood’ or ‘timber’. As ‘sine’ is an early and alternative spelling of ‘sinew’, Wright plausibly suggested that the first element in ‘sine-tree’ was the early spelling for ‘sinew’ but the Yorkshire evidence points to an alternative explanation.",fork,KX390,,,Slaithwaite,RW33,,1686,Conistone,QS1/80/1,,1739,Lofthouse,BAS6/139,,1579,Elland,YAJ35/221,,1698,Pickering,QS1/86/5,,1747,Clapham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1817,

seisin ,,,,,,," Literally ‘possession’, a word found in connection with the conveyance of property."," 1251 ‘their attorneys put themselves in seisin of the manor’, Stokesley (YRS12/26). It occurs especially in the phrase ‘livery of seisin’; that is the formal handing over of a house, land or the like, e.g. 1488 <i>sall not delyv(er) seasyn unto aftir such a day in the next weyk after lowgh Sonnday</i>, Golcar (KM146). The particular interest in the word is in the money or items that were handed over by vendors as symbols of the change in ownership. The earliest example that I have noted is in an undated twelfth-century charter which transferred land in Skelbrooke to St John’s Priory, Pontefract: <i>Quam terram Oliverus frater eius prius donaverat, et super altare obtulerat per cultellum plicatum</i>; that is ‘at the altar of the church by a clasped knife’ (YRS30/433). In 1567 the manor of Skewkirk changed hands and the symbol was a pair of knives (<i>unius paris cultellorum</i>): Skewkirk was a former cell of Nostell Priory (YRS2/340). Later deeds provide details of a wide variety of objects: 1610 <i>lease of Roger Weddell’s farme sealed upon the grownde in the myll close and a sod cut up by me ... and delivered ... as possession of all therein conteaned,</i> Brandsby (NYRO44/48); 1611 <i>one peece of silver of the value of sixepence in the name of possession and seison thereof</i>, Kilnsey (MD247); 1666 <i>one pewter doubler in stead and name of all the premises</i>, South Crosland (G-A); 1693 <i>by presentation of a clod of earth and a warming pan</i>, Arncliffe (EG26); 1766 <i>one pewter spoon at the time of the selling and delivering</i>’, Heptonstall (MD43).

set pot  ,,,,,,,,"The OED has a reference dated 1839 which shows that the word ‘set-pot’ sometimes referred to a container used in the making of varnish or for heating items such as oil or size. It may have no direct connection with the word ‘set-pot’ as it used locally: Wright listed it in several counties in the north and north midlands. In that region the set-pot was a fixture in the kitchen; a cauldron or boiler, usually made of iron or copper. It stood above a fire-grate and was used principally for the washing of clothes in boiling water.   </br> It actually had a variety of functions: Easther noted that it was ‘for brewing purposes’ and in The Leeds Mercury Supplement of 1897 it was stated that it also had a culinary role, ‘being found useful on occasions when an extra quantity of things’ had to be cooked, ‘on the occasions of tides, feasts and at Christmas time’. </br> In 1976 Miss Annie Walker of Slaithwaite reminisced about the traditional rent dinners provided for tenants on the Dartmouth estate and spoke nostalgically of <i>mutton, tongues, beef, veal and bacon all cooked together in the set-pot … then plum pudding and rice pudding.</i> In November <i>they had boiled turnips in a big set-pot</i>. The dinners were held in local public houses, and in the evening whatever was left over was put in the set-pot with dumplings and <i>the company</i> had it. </br> The word appears to have come into use quite late, for the earliest references I have found are in undated documents of the eighteenth century. In <i>c</i>.1740 a <i>set pot</i> was listed among numerous items at Green House in Austonley and an inventory for the same property in 1799 has <i>oven, great range and sett pot in House</i> (G-A). The term occurs regularly in that sort of context in the nineteenth century: in one Gomersal document of 1827 the fixtures included <i>ranges, ovens, set pots … sinks, cisterns</i> (MD292): similarly in Halifax in 1834 we find <i>ranges, ovens, set pots, bakestones </i>(DD118). It had probably been in popular use from the time when it became customary to ‘set’ the boiler or pot in a stone or brick surround, a practice implicit in the following reference: 1743 <i>1 Pott set and stone furniture</i>, East Marton (GRD).   </br> There is evidence that similar utensils such as brewing leads, kettles and pans were ‘set’ or fixed from a much earlier date, e.g. 1481 ‘Also two brass pots, one standing in <i>le fournes</i>, the other <i>sine fournes</i>, Thornhill (Clay21); <i>c.</i>1537 <i>a grett pann sett in a fournes</i>, Halifax (YRS45/187); 1565 <i>a panne sett in a furnace xiijs iiijd</i>, Temple Newsam (YAJ15/98); 1596 <i>settinge of leades with stone or claye</i> Beverley (YRS84/71); 1699 <i>one keetell which is sett in a furness</i>, Brayton (YRS47/71). The setting of bakestones seems to be contemporary with that of set pots: 1734 <i>a sett baking stone,</i> Holmfirth (IH); 1785 <i>setting a Range, setting a Pan, setting a Bakeing Stone</i>, Ovenden (CA185). </br> Previously such implements were almost certainly moveable objects: 1485 <i>the grete brasse pot that stands in the fornese,</i> Ripon (SS64/277), but by Elizabeth’s reign wooden frameworks probably provided the first ‘settings’. The clue to that seems to be in the rare word ‘crubb’ an alternative form of ‘curb’: 1565 <i>1 brode pan and a crubbe to the same,</i> Knaresborough (SS26/178); 1636 <i>a great brewing copper … set in a wooden crubb</i>, Hull (OED). In this sense the ‘curb’ may have been a ring of timber which held the pan securely in place, possibly a cylindrical construction.

The meaning of this word may be self-evident but it is of interest because of the way it came to symbolise the ability of a lessee to gain access to the riches underground and the landowners’ need to control that access.

shearsmith  ,,,,,,,," ‘Shears’ are tools which operate by the simultaneous cutting action of two blades, larger than scissors but sharing many of the same characteristics. They were used particularly by shearmen in the final processes of cloth-making and for sheep shearing, and examples of the word are on record in the Old English period. These shears would have been made by smiths and yet the earliest example of ‘shearsmith’ in the OED as an occupational term is in the Act for Hallamshire in 1623-4. That takes no account of early surnames though, and Reaney has an example in 1325. In Yorkshire the first evidence dates from later that century: 1391 <i>Galf.</i> [Geoffrey] <i>Sheresmyth</i>, York (SS96/91); 1481 <i>John Childe, York, sheresmyth</i> (YRS6/37). The making of shears must have become a more specialised occupation in the Sheffield region by the sixteenth century: 1552 <i>John Staynfurthe, sheresmythe, </i>Tinsley, Rotherham (YRS11/167); 1592 <i>Arthur Byrley, Sheaffeild, shearsmyth</i> (YRS22/22); 1620 <i>Nicholas Staniforth, shersmith</i>, Sheffield (TWH16/179); 1655 <i>W’m Bamforth of Darnoll in the p’ish of Sheffeld shersmith</i> (PR3/194). The status of these workers is emphasised by their position alongside the cutlers and scissorsmiths when the Cutlers’ Company was founded in 1624, but they were a comparatively small and localised brotherhood, confined mostly to urban centres. The Sheffield marriage register of 1653-60 recorded four shearsmiths in Sheffield town and three in Attercliffe-cum-Darnall township, but numbers remained small. The tools listed in the inventories of Hallamshire shearsmiths were similar to those found in the smithies of other local craftsmen (FBH117-8). However, the occupation was not confined to York and Sheffield: 1571 <i>William Awemunde, shiersmythe, </i>North Cave (YRS19/6).",,SS96/91,,,York,YRS6/37,,1481,York,YRS11/167,,1552,Rotherham,YRS22/22,,1592,Sheffield,TWH16/179,,1620,Sheffield,PR3/194,,1655,Sheffield,FBH117-8,,1653-60,Sheffield,YRS19/6,,1571,North Cave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1391,
sheather,sheathmaker,,,,,," A maker of sheaths for knives, usually of leather."," In York the sheathers had traditional links with the cutlers: in 1445, for example, <i>the cutlers, bladsmythes et shethers</i> supported the Pageant of Corpus Christi (SS120/136). The term is on record there from the early fourteenth century: 1302 <i>Henricus le Schether</i>, York (SS96/9), and sheathmaker occurs as an occasional alternative: 1523 <i>Christopher Beilby, shethmaker</i>, York (YRS11/15). The occupation is on record in Sheffield from the mid-sixteenth century: 1554 <i>William Spownare, sheather and yeoman</i>, Sheffield (TWH16/89); 1591 <i>Robert Hill, Sheffeild, sheather</i> (YRS22/61); 1610 <i>Godfrey Harwood of Sheffeld, sheather</i> (TWH20/132); 1654 <i>Joshua White of Sheffeld sheather</i> (PR3/190).

shrogg ,scrogg,,,,,," A regional word for scrubby woodland, first recorded in the Towneley Mysteries."," <i>c</i>.1460 <i>I haue soght with my dogys All horbery shrogys</i> (OED). In 1697-8 James Jackson of Nether Shitlington was ambushed by two thieves on <i>the common high roade</i> near Brighouse and he told the magistrates that afterwards <i>other two men came out of a little shroge or wood </i>and joined his attackers (QS1/37/1). Easther thought that it might usually have referred to woodland ‘on a bank side’ and certainly in the Huddersfield area that fits well with the place-name. A particularly good example is <i>Dogkennel Shrogg</i> recorded in 1871 (WBD/3/264). The wood in this case is very narrow but it covers the slopes on either side of a beck which divides Kirkheaton and Whitley. The same meaning may be implicit in 1763 in <i>the Brow or Shrogg Close</i> in Esholt (MD93). </br> It was actually a common element, but found only in minor place-names, so it has received little attention. Smith listed more than a dozen examples in the West Riding and although much of the evidence was late several names are on record from the seventeenth century, e.g. <i>Shroggywood </i>(1662) in Hoyland Swaine and <i>Shrog </i>(1688) in Thornhill (PNWR7). Most of the names noted are in the southern half of the West Riding and the adjoining counties of Lancashire and Nottinghamshire, which may mean that it was simply a regional variant of ‘scrog’. This has a longer history and it is found over a wider area, including Cumberland, north Yorkshire and Scotland: Catterlen Wood in Cumberland was <i>boscus de Caterlenscrok</i> in 1292 (PNCu490) and <i>scrogscugh</i> was a Sedbergh name in 1479 (PNWR7/242). </br> In view of that it is curious to find that Long Tongue Scrog Lane in Kirkheaton is only a few hundred yards from Dogkennel Shrog. Since no early references to this name have been found it is possible that clerks or map-makers will have been responsible for the ‘educated’ spelling. This particular ‘shrog’ is again on a bank side, named after the adjoining field ‘Long Tongue’ (KHPN38).

shutt ,,,,,,,," The word ‘shot’ has numerous meanings and in one definition it is said to be a division of land. ‘Shutt’, which occurs in Yorkshire, is a possible variant and the evidence we have at present suggests that it may have come into use towards the end of the sixteenth century, as a synonym of ‘furlong’: in some cases it identified part of the unenclosed town field: 1601 <i>septem seliones terre arrabilis iacen in le overfield super shuttam sive furlangam voc. le Overshutt</i>, Kirkheaton (WBD/3/77a). In other cases it was an enclosure in what had formerly been a town field: 1604<i> that … Thomas Wood by exchange of lands might take in and inclose one close called the Neither Shuttes</i>, Lepton (WBD4/156); 1687 <i>the footway leading downe their groundes unto the shutt</i>, Northowram (WCR13/110). It remained in use wherever land was not enclosed, and often stabilised as a field name: 1680 <i>two lands more on the same shutt now in a close taken in under Bincliffe House</i>, Brampton (YAJ6/71): in this deed of exchange four divisions in the Cliff Field of Brampton had ‘shutt’ as a place-name element. </br> Lepton field maps of the 1700s show the Nether Shutts as large enclosures to the north of a town field that was still in common ownership: it is clear that this land had been cleared of trees at some early date and brought under the plough as an extension of the older Northfield. Downshutts is a relatively common field name locally and more research may show some comparisons with Nether Shutts. Certain aspects of the history of ‘outshut’, which was similarly an extension, are worth noting.

shuttle  ,,,,,,,"In contexts which relate to water mills, reservoirs or drainage systems, a ‘shuttle’ was a flood-gate; that is a hatch or ‘door’ which controlled the flow of water and needed to be raised to allow it to flow freely."," In 1880-1 the Minutes of Council for Huddersfield recorded that the Waterworks Committee <i>proceeded to Wessenden Head Reservoir … and the keys of the inlet shuttle at Shing </i>[sic for Shining] <i>Brook</i> were delivered to the Commissioners. Much earlier references have been noted: 1549 <i>to make a over shotyll a honest goyt to brynge watter to the sayd whell</i>, Ecclesfield (Miller85-6) and some of them suggest that it could be a substantial structure: 1612-6 <i>all the tymber … needfull for the shuttlestocke … all boards for an over shuttle,</i> Golcar (DD/RA/f/4a): the ‘over shuttle’ may be an earlier word for ‘pentrough’. Later references include: 1659 <i>we lay in paine that one shutle att Armitage, standing in the ground of Matthew Blackburne, in the water course … be taken up for the space betwixt Michaellmas day and Martinmas day every yeare</i>, South Crosland (WB/M); 1789 <i>for a fulling mill … weirs, dams, goits, shuttles</i>, Kirkburton (G-A).

sicklesmith ,,,,,,,," The making of sickles was a trade particularly associated with the Moss Valley in the north Derbyshire parish of Eckington, just beyond the Yorkshire border. It had been established there in the late Elizabethan period, apparently by a group of families which included the Staniforths, originally from Attercliffe. The mark assigned to John Stanyford at the Lord’s court in 1564-5 stood for <i>falcir ferreis</i>; that is iron sickles (HCC91). When John Staniforth of Eckington died in 1597 his inventory recorded <i>Syckles ready made xxix dozen</i> (IH). However, the term ‘sicklesmith’ is unrecorded there until 1690 when John Turner of Ford, <i>sicklesmith</i> made his will (IH). Early Yorkshire references to the occupation are: 1699 <i>Robertus fil’ Joh’is Taylor sickelsmith, Parke</i>, Sheffield (PR4/173); 1706 <i>John Waller of Woodthorpe Moore Side in … Handsworth, sicklesmith </i>(TWH14/88). In 1729 <i>Adam Waller, sicclesmith, laid down his fine for selling sickles without a mark</i> but 5 shillings was returned to him since this breach of the ordinances was considered to have been done in ignorance, not maliciously (HCC17). The OED has references to ‘sickle-maker’ in 1483 and 1619, but there is no entry for sicklesmith. The word was certainly in use, for Bardsley quoted ‘John <i>Sykelsmith</i>’ as an early undated surname, though he considered it to be the origin of Sixsmith, wrongly I suspect.",,HCC91,,,Attercliffe,IH,,1597,Eckington,IH,,1690,Ford,PR4/173,,1699,Sheffield,TWH14/88,,1706,Handsworth,HCC17,,1729,np,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1564-5,

sink (1)  ,,,,,,,To excavate a vertical shaft.," The term is found in Durham as early as 1358 (OED) and it is explained with some care in The Compleat Collier (1708); that is ‘when we sink a pit, at first we break or cut the ground four square, and the diameter of the square is generally … about 9 quarters’ (CC12). As the pit was deepened timber was used ‘in the same four square form’, until the underlying rock was reached. A Bradford lease of 1599 granted the colliers <i>libertye for sinkeinge and diggeinge of pittes</i> (MM/A/249). It could be a very dangerous operation: in 1672, for instance, <i>Robert Flowar of Sandal was sincking a coolepitt and … a great stone … fell about six yerds height upon his back</i> (QS1/11/8).

skell-boose ,,,,,,,," Although this term finds no place in either the OED or Wright (EDD) its meaning has been discussed by several writers who agree that it referred to the stalls in a cow-house.

In both these accounts a drawing showed the position the skell-boose occupied. That appears to differ from the definition offered by Canon Atkinson who defined it in his <i>Cleveland Glossary</i>, under the heading <i>skel-beast, </i>as ‘a boarded partition between stall and stall’. The distinction may be one of chronology or geography but as recently as 1985 Miss Annie Walker of Slaithwaite in the West Riding said her family used the word for ‘the divisions between the beasts in the mistal’. </br> Early references confirm that it was made of wood but they do nothing to clarify the exact meaning: 1362 ‘Megota broke burnt and destroyed one S<i>kelbose’, </i>Yeadon (SW9); 1456-7 <i>In repar. de Skelbuse per Wm Horner xxd</i>, Fountains Abbey (SS130/55).

skep ,,,,,,,"This is a word of Old Norse origin that had passed into English by the eleventh century and was used therefore over a wide area. A skep was a kind of basket or container, typically used for grain and charcoal, and these came to be associated with specific measures."," In an undated charter Peter de Brus was to pay to Nostell Priory <i>decem sceppas bladi</i> for the sustenance of one of the canons, that is three of wheat, three of oats and four of barley or rye (YRS80/199). In 1225, in Whitby, an annual tithe payment of oatmeal was said to be <i>sex sceppas pacabilis farinæ de avena</i> (SS69/220); in 1274 Peter de Brus had the right to one skep of salt (<i>unam skeppam sa</i>) from salt-pans in Coatham (YRS12/140), and in 1371 York Minster fabric accounts listed <i>vj skeppes carbonum</i> (SS35/9). Similar references to ‘coal’ in Ripon probably meant charcoal: 1470-1 <i>Et in ij skeppis carbonum vocatorum charcole</i> (SS81/216). Barley is specifically referred to: 1208 <i>j skeppam ordei</i>, Fimber (SS94/129) and wheat in four <i>skeppes</i> was paid as a kind of rent for land in Selby in 1404-5 (SAR/141). A smaller basket was the <i>the holy brede skepe</i> for which the churchwardens of Sheriff Hutton paid 1d in 1539 (YAJ36/182). </br> The full skep came to be thought of as a bushel, although I cannot say precisely when. Examples noted include <i>a bushel skepe</i> in South Cave in 1570 (Kaner69), <i>1 bushell sckep</i> in Selby in 1679 (YRS47/48) and <i>four bushel skepps</i> that were used for measuring coal in Beverley in 1755 (YRS122/36). Also in Beverley, following complaints of short measure, new regulations were drawn up in 1766 to make the skep <i>conformable to the Winchester bushel</i> (YRS122/46). The ‘bushel-skip’ was still ‘a familiar term’ in Cleveland in 1868. </br> The likelihood is that the skep was usually made of wicker, that is osiers or other small, pliant twigs, and there is evidence for that in the OED. In nineteenth-century Yorkshire glossaries it was variously described as a ‘round-bottomed willow basket without a bow’ (Whitby), ‘a basket made of willow’ (Almondbury) and ‘a basket of willow or flag-fabric’ (Cleveland). In Yorkshire that seems to be explicit in the reference to <i>one wanded skepe</i> in the inventory of William Myddilton of Stockeld in 1578 (YRS134/52) and implicit in the entry <i>leps et skeps</i> in the Fountains Abbey accounts of 1457-59 (SS130/51). Bee-hives made of straw were called skeps from 1494 at least although the earliest relevant Yorkshire reference I have seen is to <i>foure bees skeps</i> in Faxfleet in 1578 (Kaner99): an Elmswell farmer had <i>15 skepps of bees</i> in 1664 (DW239). </br> Wright has examples of the word used both domestically and in collieries and mills. A coal scuttle, for example, has invariably been referred to in parts of Yorkshire as a skep whatever material it is made of, a point made by Easther in 1883. On the other hand the <i>coal skep</i> listed in a Farnley Tyas inventory of 1814 (G-A) may have been the much bigger container used by colliers to haul material up the mine shaft. Watson (1775) defined a ‘skip’ as <i>a Box to carry coals in</i> but I do not know if he meant the domestic implement or the industrial skep.",,YRS80/199,,,Nostell Priory,SS69/220,,1225,Whitby,YRS12/140,,1274,Coatham,SS35/9,,1371,York,SS81/216,,1470-1,Ripon,SS94/129,,1208,Fimber,SAR/141,,1404-5,Selby,YAJ36/182,,1539,Sheriff Hutton,Kaner69,,1570,South Cave,YRS47/48,,1679,Selby,YRS122/36,,1755,Beverley,YRS122/46,,1766,Beverley,,,,YRS134/52,1578,Stockeld,,,,,,,,,,,,,nd,

slitting mill ,,,,,,, The first slitting mills were introduced into England from the Continent at the end of the sixteenth century and they were established in Yorkshire during the 1600s which led to a considerable expansion of the nail trade. In these mills flat bars of iron were formed into plates between rollers and then passed between grooved rolls or ‘slitters’ to produce rod iron for nail-making.," The first slitting mill in the Sheffield district was probably the one built for George Sitwell at Renishaw (Derbyshire) in the 1650s. The one at Masborough (Rotherham) was recorded in 1678 and another at Wortley, next to the forge, was first mentioned in a lease in 1684 (FBH174). Further north a lease of 1665 granted Thomas Dickin of Colne Bridge <i>liberty to erect, build and make use of a slitting mill … near the place where a corn mill … formerly stood</i> (MD335/3). A slitting mill at Kirkstall near Leeds is said to have been built in 1676 and Thoresby said in 1714 that it had been <i>erected for slitting iron into small Bars or Rods, by which Means there is a considerable Manufacture of Nails</i> (RTD167). When the lease of Wortley slitting-mill expired in 1738 the ‘utensils’ to be left there  were listed as <i>The Engine (viz. slitting machine) with 1 pair of cutters and 1 pair of Rolls, 2 Spanners, 1 Hammer, 2 pairs Furnace Tongs, 2 pairs Draw Tongs, 2 pairs Middle Tongs, 2 small Furgins, 1 Ringer, 1 Hook, 1 Chizel, 1 Weigh Beam and Scales with ½cwt., 1 Binding Bench, 2 pairs Binding Tongs, 1 Pestle, Hams </i>[sic]<i> and Grease Dishes, 2 Furnace Hooks, 1 Coal Rake, 1 Box to Break iron on, 1 Box to put Cutters in, 3 Furnaces, 2 with Bars, one without</i> (AND82).

The <i>Ordinances for the occupation of Smithes in Beverley</i> offer an insight into those workers who were considered to be ‘smiths’: 1596 ‘Every master of the said <i>arte of smithes, armourers, cutlers, swordslipers and hardewayremen’</i>, and an earlier paragraph has the following interesting definition: ‘any smith <i>working upon any stithie of iron (except could smithes)</i> shall be obedient to the Wardens and Stewards’ (YRS84/69).",cold smith; smithy,YRS84/69,,,Beverley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1596,
smithies,smithy place,,,,,," The word ‘smithy’ was used for the forge or workshop of a blacksmith but iron works on a larger scale were referred to as ‘smithies’, from the early 1400s at least."," A Derbyshire reference suggests that such smithies had a number of ancillary buildings, however modest: 1387 ‘houses, buildings and <i>Smythyhouses</i>’, Barlborough (TWH16/43). In some early Yorkshire examples ‘Smithies’ is a surname, possibly already hereditary: 1425 <i>Thomas del Smythies</i>, Sawley (WF1/11); 1432 <i>de Roberto oftheSmethies</i>, York (SS192/10). Among early West Riding ironworks so named are: 1450 <i>lez Smythiez in Tonge</i> (YRS120/63); 1538 <i>unius Molendini vocati le Yron Smithes</i>, Rievaulx (SS83/312); 1598 <i>Ecclesoule Smithies, </i>Sheffield (WPS159). There is evidence in a Honley deed of how the plural usage may have originated: 1573 <i>quoddam forgam vocat’ a paire of Smythies </i>(YDK85). The alternative ‘smithy place’ has a similar history and the two terms were interchangeable: 1482 <i>usum et occupacionem tenure de Hundesworth et fabrice ibidem vocate Smythplace</i> (Th22/244); 1507 <i>a Syte of a Smethe place to bylde an Irnesmethe both blome herth and strynge herth</i> and also the <i>Course of the Water … to turne the said Smethes</i>, Hazlebarrow, Norton (TWH14/124). In <i>Spen Valley Past and Present</i> (1893), Peel quotes the following: 1608 <i>one tenement made into two dwellings called the Smythies Place where some time stood Iron Smythies long since decayed</i>. Such ‘smithies’ are distinct from the plural of ‘smithy’ as a blacksmith’s forge: in 1557 property leased to Francis Swift of Sheffield included <i>tooe cotages and tooe smethes</i> on <i>the northweste syde of … Pinchen Crofte</i> (TWH16/105): a lease of Sir Francis Wortley’s ironworks in 1621 covered <i>All those Iron Smythees … with all houses, buildings, stringe hearths, bloom hearths, dames, streames, goats </i>[leats]<i> and water-courses thereunto belonging … with all the bellowes, tools and implements now at the said smythees</i> (Andrew22).

smithy ,,,,,,," In general the ‘smithy’ is thought of as the workplace of a blacksmith, a village forge."," In Sheffield the word had associations from an early date which require comment. Those associations are already evident in the poll tax returns of 1379 when one Sheffield resident had the by-name <i>John de Smethe</i> and paid 6d tax as a working <i>smyth</i>: no fewer than eight neighbours were also classed as smiths and there were twelve more near by in Handsworth. These were communities of smiths producing iron goods for a wider market, and the townspeople would have been familiar throughout their lives with the sound of hammers on iron. As a by-name ‘smithy’ survived in that part of Yorkshire well into the fifteenth century but perhaps not later: 1384-5 John <i>del Smythy</i>, Bradfield (TWH26/4); 1440 <i>Thomas de Smythy</i>, Ecclesfield (TWH26/9). Even in later centuries many Sheffield cutlers had what might be called a domestic smithy, and they literally worked from home: 1498 <i>a house called a Smethy and iii gardens lying to the same</i> (TWH13/109); 1615 <i>one bay of housing … used for a smithy</i> (TWH20/145). The premises were humble buildings, often lean-tos or in backyards: Richard Kirk was taxed on two hearths in 1677, but protested that the former kitchen hearth had been converted into a smith’s forge three years earlier (FBH102). When the burgesses of Sheffield leased a house in <i>the Castlegreene</i> in 1610 to a cutler called Laurence Braywell, with <i>all smithyes fouldes</i>, they used ‘fold’ in an urban context that foreshadows its development in the nineteenth century (TWH20/133).",smithies,TWH26/4,,,Bradfield,TWH26/9,,1440,Ecclesfield,TWH13/109,,1498,Sheffield,TWH20/145,,1615,Sheffield,FBH102,,1677,Sheffield,TWH20/133,,1610,Sheffield ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1384-5,

Other instances occur in the Cutlers’ Company records but the lack of references from soon after 1700 can be explained by the development and popularity of the ‘smoothing-box’ or ‘box-iron’. When William Harrison died in 1692 he described himself as a ‘boxmaker’ whereas the appraisers of his inventory referred to him as a ‘smoothing-ironmaker’. The boxmakers produced a great variety of wares but the likelihood is that at least some of them were really making box-irons, n.b. 1767 <i>William Newton, box iron maker</i> (HCC302).",box-iron; box maker; smoothing-iron; stithy,PR3/190,,,Sheffield,PR3/201,,1656,Sheffield,HCC302,,1767,Sheffield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1654,

sneck (1)  ,,,,,,,,"The evidence for this word is found mostly in the northern counties and parts of Scotland, and references in the OED take its history back to the early fourteenth century. The etymology is said to be obscure but a ‘sneck’ was most commonly the iron latch of a door and that meaning has changed little over the centuries. Early Yorkshire examples serve to confirm that meaning, with <i>snekkys </i>made for a cupboard in Beverley in 1409 (ERAS4/35) and <i>bandis, crokis and sneckes</i> purchased from a York blacksmith in 1443 (SS35/58): in 1419 Edmond Loksmyth provided <i>j snek ad ostium pulpiti</i> in Ripon at a cost of one penny (SS81/147). Similar references occur frequently through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in accounts concerned with building and property repairs, e.g. 1534 <i>the keys and sneke of the churche dore</i> in York (CCW163); 1615 <i>1 doer with bandes and crookes, lock and key, iron snecke and slott with all belonginge </i>for Mr Cholmeley of Brandsby (NYRO44/34). In 1673 the churchwardens of Bradford paid <i>for door bands and sneck mending </i>(BAS3/484). </br> In witness statements made before the magistrates the word occurs in quite different contexts. In 1701 a Bewerley bailiff called Thomas Simpson was reported as having come<i> to the house, the door being shutt, and opened two snecks or latches </i>(QS1): the clerk evidently recognised ‘sneck’ as a dialect word and added ‘latch’ for the benefit of the magistrates. In Calverley, in 1738, a witness <i>heard the sneck of Dobson’s shop door lift up</i> (QS1). </br> A series of East Riding title deeds provides possibly the most interesting use of ‘sneck’. In 1538-9 when property in North Cliff changed hands, the deeds had on the reverse side full details of the ‘livery of seisin’; that is the formal recognition of the change in ownership. In one case it states that the grantor, by his own hands, had delivered possession <i>by the snekke of the dore in the name of the hole lands</i>. In this case it seems that the sneck may have been removed and handed to the purchaser as a symbol of the property that he was entering into (YRS102/47).

The use of ‘yellow wire’ for snares was usual in the 1600s, possibly wire made from an alloy of copper and zinc. In 1693 a Heckmondwike man was said to have <i>set severall snares both yallew and blew wyer</i> (QS1).

snig ,snag,,,,,,," A difficult word. The OED has no early examples but Wright offers ‘to chop’ or ‘to lop off branches’ as possible meanings.

It may be a variant spelling of the verb ‘to snag’ which had similar meanings but a much longer history: 1608 <i>Richard Marshall stubbes and snagges wodd in Brandesby oxeclose</i> (NYRO44/45).

A lease of 1597 states that it was not lawful to make water courses <i>under the howses and buildings, orchards, gardens, yeardes, garthes and Bakesides</i>, Beeston (DB129/4). </br> The word occurs in many of the earliest leases, both as a noun and a verb: 1582 <i>the said myne of coals, with free liberty from time to time to make and dig the soughs and new pittes</i>, Northowram (HAS31/74); 1599 <i>libertye for sinkeinge and diggeinge of pittes … And for Sougheinge … and dryeing of the said Cole myne</i>, Shelf (MM/A/249); 1720 <i>walling a peece of the sough</i>, Farnley (MS14). The lower end of the sough was referred to as the ‘tail’: 1692 <i>for the sough tayle feying</i>, Farnley (MS11); 1814 <i>railing sow tail</i>, Ovenden (HAS32/280). The Tong accounts of 1761-2 have payments to John Cowburn <i>for throwing up an open tail </i>and entries for<i> 6 days at the open tail </i>and <i>78 yards driving open tail</i>. In the same sequence is a payment of 3d <i>for a load of Sods to Cover Sow with </i>and <i>Michael Crossley 1½ days leading Stone to Cover Sow</i> (Mss4c/6).

The Compleat Collier (1708) has the following interesting piece: ‘if we meet with a great Feeder of Water in Sinking a Pit in a Working Colliery … which Water … is by a drift or Watercourse from the old Pits, set away to the place where your Collery Water is all drawn’ (CC5).

The analogy is absolutely clear in the accounts of ironworks in Sussex: in 1542-3, for example, money received for swine pannage drew a distinction between <i>Sowes, pygges and shottes</i>: stocks of iron in 1563 were similarly referred to as <i>Sowes</i> and <i>Shott</i> (CAM15/50,184).

Spanish iron ,,,,,,,," When we read that the Sheffield cutlers argued in favour of importing Spanish iron in the 1660s that may seem to signal a new departure but it is known that in the Tudor period high-grade Spanish ores were preferred by the Hallamshire cutlers to the local Tankersley ironstone. It was a move encouraged by the Earl of Shrewsbury whose steward was responsible for their importation via the river port of Bawtry, some twenty or so miles to the east (FBH9,55). In 1537 Henry <i>Rensha’</i> of Chesterfield had <i>Speynyshe yron unwroight</i> worth £9 recorded in his inventory (IH).

spoil ,,,,,,," As a noun ‘spoil’ referred initially to loot or plunder, that is the ‘spoils of war’ and it was only much later that it came to be associated with damage."," A Ripon document is quoted in the OED as the first use of the word to imply that the landscape had been spoiled or ‘rendered unserviceable’: 1609 <i>Commons, Wastes, Spoils, Heaths, Moors </i>followed almost immediately by <i>the spoil of the same Woods</i> (SS81/334). Similarly, a survey of the king’s woods in the North Riding in 1608 lists several woods in the East Ward and then has a marginal note saying <i>Waste </i>followed by <i>it is not above 16 or 17 yeares since that they weare spoyled</i> (NRR1/12). In fact it is not certain that we should understand ‘spoil’ in these cases to mean ‘damage’, since ‘the spoils’ were assets, like the ‘wastes’.The meaning may be that the trees had been illegally lopped and topped – plundered that is. If that is the correct interpretation, it marked a transitional stage in the word’s meaning: in a survey of 1568 it was said that <i>theire hath bene muche spoile and wayst maid in the said Park of Blansbye … to the value of one thousand lodes</i> (NRR1/208) and at the Leeds manor court in 1666 Richard Maud presented a tenant <i>for trespass of swine eating and spoyling his grass</i> (Th26/133). </br> Be that as it may, ‘spoil’ in the sense of refuse material from industrial workings is a meaning first noted in the seventeenth century, explicitly linked to damage done by coal-mining. Leaseholders of the Earl of Cumberland’s pits in Craven were required in 1629 to deliver up the work site <i>unspoiled and tennentable</i> at the end of their term (YAJ64/160). Compensation was made further south in 1699 <i>for the spoile and damage done to the … owners of the respective lands and grounds</i>, Goldthorpe (WN); 1702 <i>no unnecessary spoyle or destruccon</i>, Thornton (DBB1//2//30); 1732-3 <i>if the Spoil and damage done to my lands … was to be added to the Expences it would reduce the neat profits</i>, Horsforth (SpSt/5/4/1/9).",,SS81/334,,,Ripon,NRR1/12,,1608,North Riding,NRR1/208,,1568,Blansbye,Th26/133,,1666,Leeds,YAJ64/160,,1629,Craven,WN,,1699,Goldthorpe,DBB1/2/30,,1702,Thornton,SpSt/5/4/1/9,,1732-3,Horsforth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1609,

spout  ,,,,,,,A pipe by which water is carried off a roof.," 1392-3 <i>Et in salario Ricardi de Bettes facientis guturas cum spowtis super quondam novam cameram,</i> Ripon (SS81/113). Similar spouts drained excess water from bridges, and in 1683 the tenancy of Wakefield bridge-house carried with it the obligation to scour <i>the Water course, on both Sides of the said bridg, And keep open all and every of the Spouts thereunto belonging </i>(QS1). Evidence for ‘spouts’ on vessels used to hold water dates from the fifteenth century: 1444 <i>lego eidem j laver cum ij spowtes deaurat</i>., Beverley (SS30/101). The earliest evidence for spout meaning a spring of water is in minor place-names, as in an undated thirteenth-century Bradfield document: ‘the brook called <i>le Sputesyke</i> (TWH14/1). This was possibly the source of the place-name Spout House: 1316 ‘all that messuage ... at <i>le Spouthous</i> ... in <i>Bradfeld</i>’ (TWH20/9), although Smith noted three places so called in the township which could not ‘be distinguished’ (PNWR1239). ‘Spout’ was actually a very common element in the Pennines, with numerous Spout Houses and minor names such as Spout Field, Spout Hole, Spout Ing (PNWR8/171). More directly linked to the meaning suggested is the Cumbrian <i>Sputekelde </i>of <i>c</i>.1200 (PNCu).  </br> The springs from which people formerly fetched water were certainly called spouts, and yet references are scarce: 1775 <i>neither will fetch the Spoutwater of John Armytage without leave</i>, Lindley (G-A). More specific is an entry in the court roll of Heptonstall which links the vocabulary item to a particular name: 1577 ‘a croft called Wellcroft ... from the <i>spowte called the Middle Spowte’</i> (HAS37/133).

When a wood was managed so that a section might be felled in each year of the coppice cycle the sections could also be called ‘springs’: 1599-1600 <i>The woodes beyng deuyded into 8 springes every yeare is one spring felled wich at 8 yeares growth is worth 20s the acre</i>, Settrington (YRS126/29). In some districts the term ‘spring wood’ became usual for a coppice: 1514 ‘the hedges between his <i>Spryngewoddes</i> and those of John Stone’, Shepley (MD225); 1766 <i>All such Trees & Polls as are set out to be felled in three Spring Woods in Quarmby:</i> in the same document it was used as a verb and verbal noun in the sense of ‘to grow’ and ‘growing’: <i>the future Springing and Growth of the said woods</i> (DD/T/33/1). At some stage the verb also came to mean ‘to fell’. It seems to have moved already towards that meaning in a lease of 1684 which referred to <i>the last fall or spring of the same woodes … brush & underwood taken out … all sprung and cleansed</i>, Tong (Mss3/372); 1743-4 <i>Joseph Dyson for springing Hutchen Wood 15s</i>, Kirkheaton (WBE/1/18).

stack ,coal-stack,,,,,," A pile or heap, commonly of farm crops."," 1658 <i>a hay stacke in the hay stead & hay at home,</i> Selby (YRS47/5). References to stacking coal are late, probably because the use of land for that purpose was not readily granted: agriculture took precedence over coal-getting for centuries. The term ‘pit-hill’, which is dealt with separately, is evidence that coals might be laid or stacked on the ground surface, certainly from the seventeenth century, and  leases confirm that: 1659 <i>with free and sufficient grounde leave for the layeinge of all such coals as shall be … had or wrought</i>, Wibsey (MM/A/255);  1699 <i>liberty of getting coals, sinking pitts, laying, stacking, stadleing and carrying away coals</i>, Goldthorpe (WN); 1729-31 <i>for a man stacking of the coals,</i> Swillington (CKY37). </br> In Lepton the right to stack was clearly linked with commercial interests: 1739 <i>liberty … to get and Sell and Carry away … and Liberty to stack Coals</i> (WBD/4/320); 1792 <i>liberty to open and sink pitshafts … and the coals gotten to draw out, sell and dispose of at their will and the same coals … to place, stack and continue upon the ground</i>. However, the permission to stack was not indefinite, lasting only until the coals <i>be conveniently sold</i> and carried <i>away with horses</i> (WBD/3/222).  The right to stack pit waste soon followed: 1813 <i>liberty to … place and stack the Coals and Earth and Rubbish dug out of the pits on the Ground adjoining such Pits making reasonable satisfaction to the occupiers … for all Damages</i>, Beeston (DB129/1).

stainer ,,,,,,, In York the stainers were probably working with cloth rather than with wood.," Inventories provide occasional information: in 1565 the Earl of Lennox had property at Temple Newsam which included <i>two benkers stayned with armes; </i>that is two coverings for a bench or chair which had his coat of arms ‘stained’ on them, perhaps to resemble tapestry. Similar items were <i>imbrodered</i> or had <i>crewlez nedle worke</i> (YAJ25/95).

The distinction in meaning is not always absolutely clear: 1283 <i>culturam meam in</i> … <i>Overstathecroft</i>, Acaster (YRS10/325); 1380 <i>in the northern meadows of Snaythe on the east side del Stathe</i> (YRS111/159). On the other hand Hull had numerous staithes from the fourteenth century: 1347 <i>the common staith called Aldburgh stathe</i>, <i>Munkegate staith</i> (YRS141). In York and other inland ports the evidence is a little later: 1404 <i>Resumptio stathe, pavimenti et inclusi</i>, Selby (SAR138); 1434 <i>pro reparacione stathe fracte super ripam Use</i>, York (SS192/18). </br> By the fourteenth century there were landing stages in Newcastle upon Tyne where coal might be loaded onto ships but the staiths which served collieries in Yorkshire were much later: 1778 <i>the Town and Neighbourhood of Leeds have not, of late Years, been sufficiently supplied with Coals from the Coal-Staith </i>(Th40/60); 1833 <i>Walker is going to drive a great trade and is … setting up coal staithes at Halifax, Bradford, and other places</i>, Shibden (HAS31/110).

In 1705-8, for example, witnesses in a Swaledale boundary dispute referred to boundary markers called <i>Browney gill standard</i> and <i>Ridmer Standerd</i> and these were almost certainly stone cairns (YRS162/156,303). More explicit was mention of <i>a hurrock or standard called Gibbon Hill</i>, for ‘hurrock’ is a more common dialect word for a pile of loose stones (EDD). At the west end of Swaledale is the prominent cairn called Jack Standards, thought to be a Bronze Age burial site (AF122), and Dent had its <i>three standerts</i> (PNWR6/260). The best known of all the ‘standards’ though is Nine Standards Rigg. These are relatively tall cairns and references to this name date from the first half of the seventeenth century (PNWe2/29).",,"YRS162/156, 303",,,Swaledale,AF122,,nd,Waledale,PNWR6/260,,nd,Dent,PNWe2/29,,nd,Nine Standards Rigg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1705-8,

statutes ,,,,,,," Statutes, or Statute-sessions, were fairs or gatherings during which servants were hired, and they are said to have had their origin in two early Elizabethan statutes."," The customary arrangements involved the chief constables, the petty constables, the masters and the servants. Instructions had to be sent out, warrants issued, and a sequence of ‘sittings’ arranged. The procedures were complicated, but they are explained in detail in 1642 by Henry Best, an East Riding farmer. Things were set in motion he said at the beginning of November and the hirings would usually be completed by Martinmas (Nov.11). A short extract from his farming book gives us some idea of what took place on the day of the fair. </br><i>When yow are aboute to hyre a servant, yow are to call them aside and to talke privately with them concerninge theire wage. If the servants stande in a church-yard, they usually call them aside and walke to the backe of the Church, and their treate of theire wage. And soe soone as yow have hyred them, yow are to call to them for theire ticketts, and thereby shall yow bee secured from all future dainger. Theire ticketts cost them ijd. a peece, and some Masters will give them that ijd. againe, but that is in the Masters choise, unlesse they condition soe before the servant bee hyred </i>Elmswell (DW140). </br>The ‘tickets’ referred to by Henry Best were explained as the papers given by masters to their servants as confirmation that they had completed their contracts and were free to be re-engaged. In many cases the bargain was sealed when the servant was given an earnest or god’s penny. </br> The custom may have differed from one region to another. According to Peter Brears the statutes took place ‘in all the market towns’ of the East Riding on 23 November, and the diarist Arthur Jessop noted that in 1741 <i>Huddersfield Statutes</i> were on 21 October (YRS117/65); in 1760 the Wakefield cloth ‘frizzer’ John Brearley wrote in his memorandum book: <i>On the 11th of November there is a fair att Wakefild for fatt cowes and bullocks and horses and on the 12th men and women hires themselves.</i> In the margin he added the words <i>called stattues, </i>a local pronunciation of ‘statutes’ (YRS155/56). The Fishlake constable wrote in 1689 that he had spent a shilling <i>goinge to Hatfield stattis </i>(GRD), a spelling similar to the ‘stattice’ or country statute recorded in the OED (1847). Peter Brears must have encountered this version of the word very frequently since he described the fairs as the <i>stattis</i> or Martinmas hirings (TFY27). In George Eliot’s Adam Bede the fairs were called ‘stattits’ (1859).",,DW140,,,Elmswell,YRS117/65,,1741,Huddersfield,YRS155/56,,1760,Wakefield,GRD,,1689,Fishlake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1642,

steel ,,,,,,,," The word dates from the Old English period and in many of the earliest references it is linked with iron. Chaucer wrote of arrows that were made of gold: <i>sharpe for to kerven weel But iren was ther noon ne steel</i>. Steel is actually a general term for several alloys of iron and carbon that have been produced artificially so as to have greater hardness and elasticity: this makes them more suitable for industrial purposes and the production of edge tools. It is difficult to define the word in the early period, for steel was being made in different places using different methods. A Hallamshire account book records the arrival in 1574 of <i>vj Barrells of Steele … Layd in the stawre howse at Sheffield Castle</i> (MD192): this cargo had been imported from the Continent via Bawtry. Even in the mid-1600s Britain still lagged behind several other European countries in its manufacture, and relied heavily on imports. That began to change once the cementation method had been introduced, and Huntsman’s invention of crucible or cast steel finally helped Sheffield to become the steel capital of Europe. The product there was more uniform in composition and freer from impurities than any steel previously produced.

stone-breaker ,,,,,,,," In several bridge contracts there are references to workmen ‘breaking’ stone, a term which seems to have a straightforward meaning. The OED entries for ‘break’ do not link the word with ‘masoncraft’ and it is presumably excluded for the reasons given there in the preliminary note. The examples quoted here suggest that the word may have had a more precise meaning in connection with quarrying than at first appears, and fourteenth-century sources hint at that significance, notably three distinct by-names: 1322 <i>in stipendio vnius Cementarii & vnius hominis lapidos in quarrera frangentis & eosdem in dicto stagno cubantis</i>, Leeds (Th45/88); 1348 <i>John le Stonebrekar,</i> Holmfirth (WCR2/26); 1350 <i>Adam Staynwright</i>, Holmfirth (WCR2/214); 1327-8 <i>Roger le Stonhewer</i>, Stannington (TWH20/12). The inference is that these represent three different phases in the preparation of stone for building purposes; that is ‘breaking’, ‘hewing’ and ‘working’. These were different tasks and they required different skill levels, presumably with different rates of pay, although a mason might have to cross the boundaries. When Thomas Kidd was contracted in <i>c</i>.1690 to build a shippon at Conistone he was <i>to breake all the greet Stone ... & to hew one doore</i> (RW28). </br> The distinctions appear to be borne out by the terms of the Kirkstall Bridge contract of 1619 which referred to <i>the breaking, hewing and workinge of the severall sorts of stones thereto belonginge, after theise severall rates</i> (BAS6/147). A later paragraph records the <i>confesion of the Stonebreaker that he hath received xijli</i>. In 1422 it was agreed that the masons building Catterick Bridge should have free entry to two specified quarries <i>for to brek the stane that schalle go to the said brigge</i>. The occupation of stone-breaker would have been even older, and the wage accounts for Bolton Priory in 1296-7 contain the entry <i>Et cuidam fractori lapidum iijs vjd</i> (YRS154/71). Similarly, payments were made to several stone-breakers in York, for example: 1399 <i>Et in fractura lapidum per Johannem Waryn per xv sept. et iij dies, cap. 18d. per sept</i> (SS35/14).

stone bridge ,,,,,,,," The Catterick Bridge contract of 1422 was for <i>a brigge of stane oure the watir of Swalle</i>, one with three arches, to replace <i>the olde stane brigge</i> (NRQS3/33): Lady’s Bridge <i>over the watyr of Dune</i> in 1486 was <i>a Brygge of ston</i> with five arches (HS1/59). These were not the earliest stone structures in the county, for the Ripon place-name <i>Staynebriggegate</i> is on record from the very early thirteenth century (SS74/60). The street led to a stone bridge across <i>Skyteryk</i>, a sewer which flowed into the Ure east of the town (SS74/62). In fact there were stone bridges in York and on monastic sites even earlier.

The OED also has ‘strait work’ and quotes Gresley (1883): ‘the system of getting coals by headings or narrow work’. The ‘headings’, which seem likely to be what were called ‘headways’ in The Compleat Collier (1708), were not ‘wrought so wide as the other Works or Boards’ but from them the individual work-places branched off to either side (CC34). It is employed as a verb in the Farnley accounts: 1704 <i>straitebord the Watergate</i> (MS11), possibly a reference to cutting through for a drainage channel. The excavation of such passages was skilled work which gave the workman the same status as a ‘pickman’.",head; pick; straight head,MS11,,,Farnley,Mss4c/5,,1760,Tong,MS11,,1704,Farnley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1693,

street  ,,,,,,,,"In certain major place-names, the element ‘street’ and forms derived from it were the specific or first element, evidence of an ancient paved way, especially a former Roman road, e.g. Strafforth, Sturton (PNWR7/252). That use of the word persisted long enough to feature in minor names such as Tong Street, and <i>The hye Street </i>in Lindley, on a Robert Saxton map (1609) in Kirklees archives: both these are on the line of Roman roads. </br> It was used also of a paved way between buildings in a town or village, with examples from the eleventh century, for example: <i>c</i>.1090 <i>Nordstreta</i>; 1150-61 <i>Cuningesstrete, </i>York (PNER285,295); 1318 <i>strete in front of the Friars Preachers</i>, Beverley (PNER195); 1415 <i>Fynkelstrete,</i> Hull (PNER211); 1557 <i>in every of the three stretes in Wakefelde</i> (Th27/124). Even though ‘gate’ was the usual word for a way or street in Yorkshire, ‘High Street’ has a long history there, recorded in Hull as <i>le Heighe Streete</i> in 1321 (PNER212) and subsequently over a wide area: 1536 <i>his movable guddes and howssehold stuffe dyd cast forth of the sayd howsse into the Hygh Strett,</i> Whiston (YRS70/139); 1563 <i>one common Street commonly called the hieghe streate,</i> Aldborough (YRS74/35); 1585 <i>They lay in pain that Henry Nayler do remove his maner and donnge which he hathe laid in the hie streete, that others may leade there</i>, Dewsbury (YAJ21/428); 1609 <i>le Highestreete in Earlesheaton</i> (WCR11/39). However, in individual cases it is not always certain how High Street should be interpreted, whether as a highway or as a major street in a town. </br> Nor can we ignore the influence of clerks who were not local men, especially from the seventeenth century when ‘town street’ began to feature in the records, replacing the regional word ‘town-gate’: 1654 <i>those of Crathorne and Yarm for not repairing their town streets or gates</i> (NRQS5/155); 1730 <i>the Town Street in Hallifax</i> (QS4/27/27).

William Elles was assigned a mark for his knives (<i>pro cultellis ferreis signando</i>), and provision was made lest any other person strike [<i>percutiet</i>] that mark (TWH28/57). The use of the expression in English soon followed and in 1590 the Sheffield cutlers were ordered not <i>to stryke anye marke</i> on their knives except the one assigned to them, and not to <i>stryke anye other marke</i> (HCC3). In 1730 Thomas Warburton was accused of <i>engraving upon his razors contrary to his Mark</i> (HCC17). The marks were made on forged items such as knives and scissors by hammering the blades with a mark punch, about 8 cm long and 1-5 cm across. Little is known about their manufacture and it was assumed by Unwin that cutlers made their own.

strip ,,,,,,,," Found several times in church terriers and tithe disputes, where it referred specifically to a cow. In 1743, for example, the Easter dues in Kirkheaton parish included a penny <i>for every strip</i> (LTK110). The editor took this to be a reference to a strip of ground in the open field but a South Crosland farmer makes the meaning clear in his day book: 1768 <i>If a Cow Renew not within the year She is called A strip; the Town of Marsden by specious </i>[sic]<i> Custom pays Nothing for A strip </i>(GRD); in the Almondbury terrier of 1770 it was <i>by special custom</i>. </br> The OED has no examples of the noun but quotes uses of the verb ‘to strip’ from 1610 which point to a connection. It is defined there as ‘to extract the milk remaining in the udder after the normal milking, especially by a particular movement of the hand’. The EDD has similar examples in counties from the Midlands to Scotland, the earliest being for the East Riding in 1788. In fact a tithe dispute takes this use back to 1553 when the Proctor family were farmers of Gargrave vicarage.

stub (2)  ,,,,,,,"By the sixteenth century to ‘stub’, or more explicitly to stub up a tree, was to remove the stubs or stumps of those that had been felled, so that the land might be ploughed."," In 1520 a Fountains Abbey lease granted Ralph and Robert Scayfe of Bishopside <i>libertye to stube upe and clense certain growndes … to ther more advantage and profett</i> (YRS140/170): in 1587 Sir John Kaye of Woodsome and his workmen <i>dyd stubb a pece of the Carr beyond the Brodyng, calling yt the Great Stubbing</i> (KayeCP) and in Ilkley <i>verie woddy and bushey grounds </i>were<i> stubbed and made arable </i>in 1591 (YNQ2/26). </br> The West Riding Quarter Sessions record a tragic accident in 1675 which paints a vivid picture of the dangers that such work involved: Joseph Hirst of East Ardsley testified that he had been <i>stubbing of a tree … And being fetching of this blow with his axe, Stephen Allen, unknowne to </i>[him]<i>, was betwixt his blow and the root of the tree that he was then stubbing and by that meanes was Accidentally sore cut into the head. </i>The blow was not fatal but the unfortunate man was taken <i>home to his Masters … who doth maintaine him</i> (QS1). </br> ‘Stubbing’ remained a common practice and the diarist Adam Eyre noted in February 1648 that his man was <i>stubbing the ashes in the croft head</i> (SS65/95): in 1732 John Hobson wrote of <i>ploughing in a close where there had lately been some wood stubbed</i> (SS65/316) and in Beverley in 1774 the rents from the town pasture called Westwood were used in <i>stubbing up old tree roots … and clearing the said pasture as far as the money will allow</i> (YRS122/21).

stubber ,,,,,,,, The Bolton Priory Compotus has an interesting sequence of references to ‘stubber’ as an occupational term from 1311 to 1319. It begins with sums of money paid to <i>Willelmo le Stubber</i> which is likely to have been the workman’s by-name not a hereditary surname: he was once referred to just as <i>Stubber.</i> He might at that time have been cutting down trees or helping to manage the woods but unfortunately the entries are not detailed enough: they include <i>una magna falce liberata xiiijd </i>and<i> amputanti boscum xijd</i> (YRS154).

stubbing ,,,,,,,," This occurs frequently as a minor place-name element from the thirteenth century, although many early examples are in undated charters: in Worsbrough, for example, <i>Rokelaystubbing</i> was an assart (YRS39/183) as was <i>Hemmingstubbing</i> in Ilkley (YRS69/103): a grant of lands in Thorp Salvin mentions <i>le Heyestubing</i>, ‘Willstubbing’, and ‘Aldanstubbing’ (YRS83/169). In 1344 a plot of land called <i>le Stubbing</i> in Denby near Penistone contained fifteen acres (YRS65/48). Such ‘stubbings’ referred to assarts where the ‘stubs’ had been removed so that crops might be grown there: n.d. <i>in predicta cultura que vocatur Stubyngs post fena et blade asportata</i>, Healaugh (YRS92/75) . </br> Although the suffix was widely used in that period, its precise interpretation is not always certain. A dispute in Sowerby near Halifax in 1275 had to do with ‘a bovate of land with a garden and a stubbing’ leased to William Brun. William then accused the owner of breaking their agreement by throwing down the stubbing and carrying it away: <i>et dictum stubbing prostravit et asportavit</i> (YRS29/37,115). This was clearly not a direct reference to a clearance and in view of later meanings discussed in woodland glossaries it should perhaps be interpreted as coppice wood or brushwood. It may be that in some early clearances the stubs were left standing for a number of years, serving as pollards or stovens. See ridding, royd, stubbs.

stump cross ,stub cross,,,,,,," The index to PNWR includes nine examples of Stump Cross as a place-name, in localities as far apart as Wadworth which lies south of Doncaster, Bolton by Bowland in the western dales, and Aldborough near Boroughbridge. The meaning is not in doubt but the evidence on the whole is late and my interest in the place-name lies in the evidence that ‘stump cross’ was a term in everyday use from the sixteenth century. The destruction of crosses is associated with the Reformation and its challenge to the Roman Catholic Church, and monuments continued to be destroyed through the Civil War period. The standing crosses were seen as symbols of Catholicism, and for zealous Protestants the breaking of their shafts was almost inevitably a challenge. </br> Of course many of the crosses were simply waymarkers, standing at major junctions, and they were not in themselves religious symbols although some undoubtedly came to be associated with the church, if only because they were halting-places during the processions at Rogation tide. A witness in a tithe case in 1556 recalled how before the Dissolution they would go in procession <i>to a crose in Westowe parishe,</i> or <i>to the Crose at Whitwell Beacon,</i> saying <i>a Gospell</i> in each place (YRS114/80). That did not save the waymarkers from the hammers of the iconoclasts. In a visitation of 1567 it was noted that in Warburton they had <i>a Stumpe of a crosse in their churchyeard, the head beinge smitten of,</i> and in churchyards where that had not been done the parishioners were enjoined <i>to pull downe and deface the same utterlie</i> (PTD177). </br> In many early cases therefore ‘stump cross’ was a vocabulary item, not a place-name. J.K. Hammond’s History of Eccleshill contains details of the township boundaries in 1585 which ran from<i> a close dyke and a stump cross … to Bolton out lanes:</i> in 1607 a section of the highway from Stockton to York was reportedly in great decay; it led <i>from Moncke Bridge end to a stompcross</i>: the editor attempted to explain the term ‘stump cross’, saying that it was not infrequently met with, but he did not understand its meaning (NRQS1/68). It remained in use beyond the Civil Wars and a Worsbrough bye-law of 1688 required tenants to <i>scour their ditches in the lane … up to the Stumpcross</i> (JWW). </br>It is to be expected that some examples of Stump Cross as a place-name will go back to the 1530s when Henry VIII broke with Rome, and the Act of Supremacy recognised him as head of the English church. In fact it seems to have acquired that status almost immediately for when Thomas Percy of Scarborough bequeathed land to the Black Friars in 1536-7 one acre was described as <i>lying at Stompe crosse</i> (SS106/56). In 1578 a Beverley butcher had to pay 4s fine <i>for his sheep depasturing in a Close at Stumpe Cross</i> and that is possibly the Stump Cross in Bishop Burton (YRS84/27). William Brooke <i>of Stumpcross in Batley</i> was married at Leeds in 1739 (PR). </br> The frequency of the evidence from the 1530s actually makes a contribution to the history of ‘stump’ as a word. This is on record from the fourteenth century and for much of its earliest history it referred to the part of a limb which remained after amputation. From <i>c</i>.1440 it was used also of a standing tree-trunk and that may have played a part in the popularity of stump cross as a vocabulary item. In 1577, for example, the mayor of Beverley received 5s <i>for 2 stump trees in Westwood </i>(YRS84/8). There is also interest in the parallels that exist between ‘stump’ and ‘stub’, although ‘an etymological connexion is difficult to make’ (OED). Of course ‘stub’ has a much longer history as a word for the rooted portion of a felled tree but it is worth noting that ‘stub cross’ is in use as a place-name earlier than stump cross. Two examples are <i>Stob crose</i> in Brampton Bierlow in 1516 (PNWR1/109) and <i>le Stub crosse </i>in Pontefract in 1475 (Th26/220). There were evidently broken crosses before the Reformation.

sycamore ,,,,,,, A tree of the maple family which is said to have been introduced into Britain but is now thoroughly naturalised.," The Romans are considered by some to have brought it here but one argument against that is the absence of ‘sycamore’ in early place-names.

tavern ,,,,,,,," As a verb this occurs in Yorkshire from the fourteenth century and it was quite frequent in the Tudor period. It evidently has a longer history, for Latin references have been noted in co. Durham from 1365 (OED) and in north Yorkshire in 1453 (AW158). In most contexts the practice clearly had to do with sub-letting property, and the first English usage is in an undated fifteenth-century document: <i>yhe schall inquiere if any man have tavernede his place … or any parcel of his lande</i>, Fountains Abbey (AW158). It was seen as an offence in most places, since it led to smaller holdings, especially in regions where partible inheritance was general. In 1511 when the Hardcastle family held the tenancy of Thrope in Nidderdale they were instructed not <i>to taberne nor lat to ferme thair said tenement ne no parcel thairof unto any oder persone</i> (SS42/320). In 1551 Christopher Dodsworth left an instruction in his will that if his wife happened to<i> latt or taverne any parte of the said fermehold</i>, his son was to have it, Jolby (SS26/72). There were other considerations, especially where the tenement was barely able to support one person. In 1575 the State Papers argued that if such a tenant died and divided the holding between two sons <i>the taverninge of the Queynes lande ys hinderance for kepinge of hors and armor</i> (OED). The latest reference that I have noted is in a survey of the East Riding village of Settrington in 1600. A clause inserted into tenancy agreements there restricted sub-letting, saying that no part of the tenement was <i>to be tauerned butt so as all may returne & continue together the last five yeares before the end of the lease</i> (YRS126/82). The use of the verb in this way appears to have been a northern practice but the word shares the same origin as tavern in the sense of ‘public house’. The OED explanation is that both referred initially to sheds or small buildings, and that to ‘tavern’ first meant to build a cottage on a tenement.

taw ,,,,,,,," The word is of Old English origin and the OED has references from that period.

tentale ,,,,,,,,"An advertisement for a new colliery in Beeston, in The Leeds Mercury of 4 Jan. 1780, has a Yorkshire example of this word: </br><i>To be Lett, the Working of the abovesaid Colliery, by the Great or Tentale as practised in the North. The Undertaker to defray all Expenses as Colliers, and all other Workmen’s Wages; to find materials of every kind necessary for the working of the said Colliery, as well as for keeping in Repair the large Engine lately thereon erected  as also the Roads already made, as well as making and repairing new Roads necessary to new Pits; to make and repair all Ginns and other Utensils necessary for the same; to sink such fresh Pits as will be needful during the Remainder of the Lease, having Twelve Years unexpired … to be Let at so much per Dozen of Twelve Corves … for a specific Quantity, not less than Ten Thousand such Dozens per Ann. the Dozen of Corves … are expected to weigh not less than 26 Cwt of well-dressed coals</i> (Th40/128). </br>‘Tentale’ here is used as an alternative to ‘by the great’ which was commonly employed in the West Riding with reference to piece work as opposed to an hourly rate. The ‘tentale’, that is a count of ten, was a term used in the north-east and according to Greenwell it originally referred to a system of payment based on the amount of coal mined, which varied under different landlords  in some leases the ‘ten’ was fixed at 50 tons. Gresley said that it was a rent or royalty paid by a lessee upon every ‘ten’ of coals worked in excess of the minimum or certain rent. As the Brandling family had moved from Northumberland to Leeds they had almost certainly brought the term with them, hence the reference <i>as practised in the North</i>.

tenter  ,,,,,,,"The tenter was a simple wooden structure on which cloth was stretched after the fulling process, and it consisted of posts and two bars, the upper and the lower."," The earliest references are in the towns: 1506 <i>cloth taken of the tentours</i>, York (YRS106/21); 1648 <i>the abuse of Clothyers in making tenters of greater Chase than by the statute is limited</i>, West Riding (QS4/2/196); 1727 <i>tenters not marked or numbered each yard distinctly, fairly and plainly to be seen upon the top bar</i>, West Riding (QS1/66/9). The long history of the word is clear from by-names: 1250 <i>Adam del Tentur</i>, York (YRS12/22) and minor place-names, as in Pontefract where ‘a messuage called <i>le Tenturgerde</i>’ is mentioned in 1322 (YAJ12/302). In those towns, areas were set aside where the tenters might be permanently placed and such sites can be identified on maps, especially from the eighteenth century. However, rural clothiers had to find temporary accommodation for the tenters near to the house, in a close or croft, and these would come later to be called Tenter Close or Tenter Croft. Such names do not reveal the problems raised by this change of land use but the spaces where tenters were sited were temporary and referred to in early deeds as ‘rooms’: 1575 <i>with on tenter rowme where there is one tenter now standing in the crofte upon the south ende of the howsinge</i>, Sowerby (YRS50/175); 1598 <i>one garden, one fold, two tenterrowmes where as they now stande</i>, Thurstonland (G-A). Such rooms had to be accessible and this inevitably gave rise to questions about rights of way. An enclosure was the subject of an agreement in 1653 which allowed John Cowper to<i> quietly enjoy the said close ... excepte one tenter rowme</i> ... and granted to Richard Dison <i>liberty to fix and sett one tenter there ... with sufficient ways and passages ... at all times to and from the same tenter</i>, Dalton (KC6/15). There will have been close supervision of the sites so granted: 1651 <i>license to erecte, sett up and use two paire of tenters for tentering of woollen Cloth within the Crofte before the dore of the messuage ... soe as the ground whereon the same Tenters are to be sett doe not extend twenty yeardes in length and twenty yeardes in breadth And soe as the same tenters be sett upp within twenty yeardes of the aforesaid house,</i> Lepton (WBD/4/194).

tew-iron ,,,,,,, This refers to a nozzle through which a blast of air is forced into a forge or furnace.," It derives from the French word which gave modern <i>tuy?re</i> and early OED spellings include tewer, tuer, twyer and tewyre. The reference in 1350-1 to <i>ij tuers ferri</i> makes it clear that the nozzle could be of iron, and popular etymology was responsible for ‘tew-iron’ and similar spellings. It was almost predictable, given that ‘ire’ was a regional alternative to iron, n.b. 1343 <i>Roger le Irmongere</i> (OED). The development may have taken place in the sixteenth century and the OED notes it in Durham in 1570 when a smith gave <i>vnto John Dycheborne a pair of bellowis with a tewe Ireon</i> (SS2/329).

Wright comments on the word’s popularity in some mining communities, and from a Cheshire source of 1878 quotes: ‘When a man has … made an opening or connection between a new and old working, he is said to have thirled’ (EDD). In fact a south Yorkshire mining lease of 1486 contains three examples of the word’s use, referring to a coal pit <i>now of new thyreled</i> and with clauses in the agreement which required the lessees to drive a head <i>with post and thyrle </i>in order to drain the mine. Finally they were to keep <i>a ribbe</i> … <i>unthyreled</i>, Cortworth (YAJ12/236).

tilt-hammer,tilt mill,,,,,," Ultimately ‘tilt’ has its origin in a word that meant to overthrow or overturn, made familiar to us by scenes of combat in which mounted knights sought to unhorse their opponents. In iron working it was the name given to a heavy hammer used in forges: this was fixed on a pivot and acted upon by a cam-wheel which alternately tilted the hammer up and then let it drop (OED)."," It is uncertain exactly when the word was first used in this sense but numerous references have been noted in the early 1700s. In 1733, for example, a partnership took a 21-year lease in order <i>to set up a tilt forge</i> not far from the Ponds in Sheffield (WPS185) and in 1736 Gosling’s map of Sheffield marked one <i>Tilt Hammer</i> in the Ponds and another further south: the first of these had already been recorded in a 1716-7 rate book. A writer noted in 1750 that <i>within these few years past no less than fifteen tilting mills</i> in and around Sheffield <i>were erected for reducing iron and steel to a smaller dimension</i> (FBH181-2). Upper Middlewood Forge was a tilt mill: 1761 <i>three cutlers wheels and a tilt and a mill for tilting steel</i>, Oughtibridge (WPS2). ‘Tilted steel’ is a term recorded from the eighteenth century: in 1734 Samuel Littlewood had <i>Tilted Steel 5 stone and an half</i> and in 1735 Joseph Morton had <i>Tilted Steele £1</i> (IH).",,WPS185,,,Sheffield,FBH181-2,,1750,Sheffield,WPS2,,1761,Oughtibridge,IH,,1734,Sheffield,IH,,1735,Sheffield,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1733,

In 1619-21 William Wood was fined <i>xs for taking two timber oke trees in Newton dale</i>, Pickering (NRR1/29). Which trees fell into the category of timber trees was capable of legal definition but might differ from one region to another: in Yorkshire, for example, in 1818, ‘birch trees were timber’ (OED). It is an element in some minor place-names, as in the grange that Roche Abbey had in Thurstonland: 1275 ‘the serjeant of <i>Tymberwode</i>’, Thurstonland (YRS29/146): when Bolton Priory was assarting land in 1313-4 expenses were incurred at <i>Tymberwath</i>, that is ‘timber ford’ (YRS154/365).

tinman,tinner,tin worker,,,,,," It is evident in early records of the Cutlers Company that tin was used by the Sheffield cutlers in a variety of ways, not all of them within the rules. In 1625 brass, lead and pewter were linked with tin as metals that should not be ‘intermixed’ with gold and silver so as to deceive potential purchasers (HCC9) but that did not halt the practice.

tinsel (1)  ,,,,,,,A regional word for brushwood which was used in fencing.," Wright found it in parts of north Wales and the midlands, and the OED has an example in Nottinghamshire in 1486.

The word was in regular employment in Yorkshire, and Jackson quotes a document dated 1473-4 in which <i>tynsell</i> was to be used for making and repairing a weir and mill dam (JB123). Occasionally it occurred as a verb: 1518-9 <i>to tynsell, to hegge Aboute the same mese</i>, Tong (Mss3/3). In a later lease it was linked with ‘trouse’: 1593 <i>liberty to cut down and carry away</i> [certain wood] <i>leaving … sufficient crops, lops, bushes, trowse and tynsell for the mowndinge, fencing and hedging of the demised premises</i>, Bingley (LRS2/7).

treacle  ,,,,,,,"This word derives ultimately from Greek but it was brought here by the Normans. Originally it was the name given to a salve which was used as an antidote to poison and apparently made up of spices and drugs, in which sense it is on record in England from 1340 (OED)."," A North Riding by-name is an earlier example, possibly metonymic for an apothecary: <i>c</i>.1211 <i>William Triacle</i>, Guisborough (SS86/192). </br>In 1464-5 John Person on the <i>Jacob </i>imported into Hull <i>23 lib’ treacle </i>and<i> 23 lib’ grengyngere</i> valued together at £1 10s 0d (YRS141/73). A similar entry links the two commodities in 1467 and the inference may be that they were to be used together, for whatever medicinal purpose. They were almost certainly being brought into Yorkshire from the Low Countries, and in one case the home port was named as Veere. The editor was of the opinion that treacle here was a ‘compound of spices and drugs on a honey base, possibly … a sugar base’, an explanation which might explain how treacle came later to be thought of as something sweet. Treacle contained in a small box was actually a fashion item from the 1400s, attached to the girdles that ladies wore around their waists: <i>c</i>.1504 <i>Item j dussan and a halfe of trehakyll boxys ijd,</i> York (SS53/193). </br> In 1693 a Selby shopkeeper had <i>London treacle 3s; Veanas treacle 1s 6d</i> (YRS47/22).</br>In Yorkshire the word was later used for the syrup produced when sugar was refined and crystallized. Treacle parkin is one of the most distinctively Yorkshire cakes, made now with oatmeal and sweetened with sugar and treacle, or ‘golden syrup’. At its best it is moist and flavoured with ginger, linked traditionally with several local customs and still popular on bonfire night. It is uncertain how old the tradition might be. The Mirfield diarist John Turner noted on 6 November 1750 that he gave one penny to his wife <i>for treacle for a parkin </i>(MS757) and one earlier reference occurs in the Quarter Sessions rolls. The year was 1729 and the offence was one of theft: Ann Whittaker’s very full statement told how <i>her Mistress did persuade her to ask Sarah Priestley … to steale meal from her master to make a parkin on</i> … <i>and sent the meal by a Little lade … and gave Sarah … some brass to Fetch Treakle with from Elland to make a Parkin.</i> The clerk referred to the finished product as <i>parkins alias cakes</i> which may imply that the magistrates were unfamiliar with the word ‘parkin’.

undertake,undertaken,,,,,,," Examples of both the verb and the noun are found in seventeenth-century bridge accounts. In 1673, the constables of Sowerby and Warley, the two townships which shared responsibility for Sowerby Bridge, petitioned the Justices of Peace, asking for a surveyor to be appointed so that workmen might undertake to carry out the repairs. Two years later the two masons who rebuilt Ilkley Bridge were referred to as undertakers of the work. The contracts in such cases obliged masons to maintain the bridges for a number of years afterwards and that was often to their disadvantage, as the following extract makes clear: </br><i>Michael Taileforth and the Rest of the Masons who built Coniston Bridge in 1684 and gave bond to uphold the same for the space of seven yeares, which said bridge being very much ruined by an extraordinary violent flood and two of the years are to expire … wee think they ought to have £100 given them … to be bound and uphould the same seven years longer </i>(QS1/29/1)</br>Later, the word acquired a more particular meaning and the ‘undertaker’ became an official appointment. In 1712, there was an agreement between the Justices of Peace for the West Riding and four named masons ‘for putting into repair all the Riding Bridges’. Further to that they were ‘to keep them so for eleaven yeares … and to leave them in good repairs at the ende of the terme’. They were to be paid a sum of £350 p.a. by the Treasurer. Joseph Pape, the mason who had built Esholt Hall in 1706 was one of those named and soon after his appointment he was referred to as the Undertaker of Bridges (QS1/56/1). In 1715, the Wapentake Bridges were <i>sett of to certaine undertakers</i> (QS1/53/1).</br>Some families, like the Carrs and the Ettys, were involved in bridge maintenance over a long period, which suggests that the various offices were looked on as attractive appointments. That seems to be confirmed by a letter written to the Justices in 1743:</br><i>Wee, Jonathan Jennings of Skipton and Peter Chippindale of Eastbye, masons, desire to be further heard touching our proposal for undertaking the repair of the West Riding Bridges. If the worshipfull Bench would please to divide them wee had rather only propose for those within the wapontake of Staincliffe and Yewcross but if they resolve to let the whole Riding in one Bargain wee have six sons all brought up in the mason trade which wee could disperse into separate parts of the Riding to keep the Bridges in better condition</i> (QS1/82/4)</br>",,QS1/29/1,,,Sowerby Bridge,QS1/56/1,,1706,Esholt,QS1/53/1,,1715,np,QS1/82/4,,1743,np,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1675,

The thinly-populated moorland fringes had abundant grazing and were ideal for animal husbandry, so vaccaries could be set up within forests, as in Marsden, or be the main activity within a township such as Scammonden, determining the pattern of settlement. Sometimes the place-names in a particular area serve to identify the sites, especially <i>booth</i> as a suffix in the de Lacy territories, and <i>t?n-stall</i> on Wakefield manor.

wainscot ,,,,,,," A superior quality of foreign oak wood, put to a wide range of uses."," In many of the earliest references the word is used in the plural, possibly because it was imported into this country in the form of boards; that is extremely thin planks. Although it is uncertain just when the first boat loads arrived, the east coast trade was certainly established by the middle of the fourteenth century: 1358 <i>Item, Johanni de Gisburgh</i> [mariner] <i>pro wainscot, j marc</i>, York (SS129/14); 1371 <i>et in lx waynscot sarrandis pro orologia et aliis necessariis in fabrica, </i>York  (SS35/8); 1409 <i>et serratoribus pro serratura lx waynscott,</i> Beverley (ERAS4/33); 1486 <i>to the kyrk werk … xxx squared trees and half c. waynscotes to the reparaciones of the stalles</i>, Beverley (SS53/19). In fact, large quantities of both oak and pine came into Hull, especially from the Baltic and Norway, and the evidence of fabric rolls shows that much of it was employed in the great churches. In Beverley, for example, it contributed to the repair of the choir stalls and was used for doors and windows. In Ripon and York it was needed for the reredos and canopy of the altar. Oliver Rackham claimed that it is possible for those who visit churches to ‘distinguish the giant, straight-grained, slow-grown oaks of Central Europe … from the small, crooked, fast-grown local oaks’. These continental trees were more versatile than native oak, and the boards were made by specialists who had the necessary skills and equipment. Fifteenth-century accounts for the port of Hull contain details of wainscots shipped from the Baltic. In 1453, the ships <i>Jacob</i> and <i>Catyntroghe</i>, from Danzig, brought in hundreds of them, along with <i>deles </i>and<i> clapholtes:</i> ships from Zeeland had <i>fyrsparres</i>. It came also to be used for panelling in private houses, and to make furniture: 1452 <i>j parvæ cofre de waynescotes</i>, York (SS45/138); 1525 <i>a copburde of waynescotte … a bed of waynescotte</i>, York (SS79/200); 1558 <i>a carved chist of waynescott in the parlor</i>, York (YRS55/224); 1607 <i>it is my mynde that no glasse, waynescott, iron barres, bedstockes, tables and stoles shalbe removed from my house … but stand as heirelomes,</i> Almondbury (YDK39).

Those who performed the office were also provided with distinctive clothing; in 1433, for example, the York waits were given a winter livery ‘<i>Liberata yemalis</i>’ (SS192/15) and in Beverley in 1720 the men received badges, chains and a blue cloak (YRS122/8). Long service was rewarded: Robert Sheyne of York, described in 1486 as <i>being in so grete age and soo decrepid </i>was granted an annual pension of 13s and free accommodation (YAS98/170). In 1782 John Leavens of Beverley was allowed 2s a week <i>having served as a wait for upwards of 50 years. </i>Some twenty years earlier he had been discharged from his office for <i>insolent behaviour to the gentlemen in the Chamber</i>, but was reinstated on begging their pardon (YRS122/41,63).",,PTDb,,,Derby,YAS30/350,,1241,Healaugh,YRS21/17,,1301,Richmond,SS96/59,,1364,York,SS96/90,,1391,York,SS192/15,,1432-4,York,YRS106/129,,1529,York,YRS74/21,,1556,Wakefield,YAJ12/468,,1641,Hull,YRS122/67,,1785,Beverley,SS192/15,,1433,York,YRS122/8,,1720,Beverley,,,,YAS98/170,1486,York,,,,,,,,,,,,,1379,

wapentake bridge ,,,,,,," The ‘wapentakes’ were formerly the subdivisions of the three Yorkshire Ridings, districts which were equivalent to the ‘hundreds’ in most parts of England. The word is of Old Norse origin and it reflects Danish influence in the county in the centuries before the Norman Conquest. Wapentake bridges were therefore bridges maintained at the expense of the Wapentake and not the Riding.  The status of a bridge could change, for various reasons, and local interests could influence that."," A case at the General Quarter Sessions at Pontefract, in 1647-8, is fairly typical. Huddersfield Bridge was <i>through the violence of water decayed and quyte taken away</i> and a sum of £30 was <i>estreated</i> upon the West Riding towards its repair, and paid over to Sir John Ramsden, a Justice of Peace but also the local lord of the manor. A dispute took place over the £30 after the repairs had been carried out and the magistrates resolved the matter in the following order: </br><i>And whereas it do appear that the Bridge is a Wappentake Bridge and ought to bee repaired at the Countryes Charge, yet in respect of the said order and that the said work is finished, it is now ordered that the said order be confirmed and that the £30 be estreated on the whole West Riding and paid to the hands of those that disbursed the moneys to disengage them, provided that these moneys … shalbe as a benevolence onely and not to bynd the said Ryding to repaire the bridge hereafter</i> ().

ware (1) ,,,,,,," A word with an Old English origin, used as a collective singular term for items of merchandise or manufacture; goods or commodities."," It came also to be used in the plural, and cutlers’ inventories for the period 1690-1739 reveal that they were making ‘common wares’ for the mass market (FBH102). In 1711, when the Cutlers’ Company was anxious about immigration into Sheffield and the security of its members, they sought to restrict the numbers of apprentices each freemen might take because <i>they make such vast quantities of wares of all sorts that they can’t sell them</i> (FBH141). Attributive uses include ‘ware tools’, presumably the tools required to produce ‘hardware’, that is ironmongery or small metal goods. In 1546, Steven Fox of Ecclesall bequeathed ‘all things belonging to his<i> shope as wayre toylles</i>’ to his son Laurence (TWH13/78). The inventory of Samuel Baylie in 1737 lists large quantities of files in his <i>Ware chamber</i>, an upper room used as a store (IH).

warp up ,,,,,,, Used when flood water deposits earth and stone on riverside land.," In 1686 a great storm destroyed bridges, property and farm land in Wharfedale: it was recorded in the Quarter Sessions Order Book for the West Riding: </br> <i> On Thursday the eighth day of June </i>...<i> betweene the hours of one and three in the afternoone … there happened an Earthquake with dreadful claps of thunder which was attended with great showers of haile and raine which descended so violently from the mountains and flowed out of the caverns of the rocks that in a very short moment it overflowed the bancks of the River and great streams ran through … Kettlewell and Starbotton driving along with them great quantities of great stones, land and sludge soe that it overturned, carried away, warpt up and made useless, uninhabitable … dwelling houses … Outhouses and Barns And carried, swept away and spoiled … household goods … and did likewise Tear up and drive away the Earth of one hundred acres and upwards of arable pasture and meadow ground … And did likewise cover with great stones, gravel and sand above 100 acres more of arable pasture or meadow ground </i>…  (QS10). </br> The estimates for repairs by masons, carpenters and surveyors have survived in detail and for these two communities alone it amounted to £3,017  7s  8d. This early use of the verb ‘to warp up’ goes far beyond the meanings given in the OED and it paints a graphic picture of houses and land choked up with river debris.

These ‘reserves’ came to be known as warrens and they were watched over by warreners: 1519 <i>that no man hawke nor hunte within my Lorde’s warraunte</i>, Selby (SS85/32); 1602 <i>hedgeing the warren</i>, Brandsby (NYRO44/18); 1726 <i>Francis Gibson of Rigton warrener of Hornbank Warren </i>(QS1/65/9). By the sixteenth century the word was more usually associated with the keeping of rabbits or coneys and the landlords’ privileges were under increasing threat. In 1498 Miles Willesthorp claimed that a body of armed men had come <i>to the more of Willesthorp … and</i> … <i>there riotously hunted the conyes … and digged up the erthis</i> (YRS41/18). In 1599-1600 <i>the cony warren</i> within the lordship of <i>Sittrington</i> was surveyed and a memorandum noted that <i>in Anncient tyme the conye warren was planted in the low commons</i>, but so many rabbits were poached that it was moved closer to the manor house (YRS126/31). The Quarter Sessions records have details of poaching in such warrens into quite recent times and <i>a warren or common called Coney Moor in Methley</i> is mentioned in 1732 (QS1/71/6). The warrener occupied a house and such dwellings are frequently referred to: 1654 <i>paid for drawinge the thack and for theakinge of the Warrand House, 4s 6d,</i> Stockeld (YRS161/91). References which list improvements to Richard Cholmeley’s property illustrate the word’s attributive uses: 1612 <i>a warren howse wall</i>; 1614 <i>my warren yeat stowpe</i>s; <i>finished my warren dyke burnynge</i>, Brandsby (NYRO44).

wash (1),wesh,,,,,,"This was one of several words for human urine, which until quite recently had a variety of industrial uses, especially in cloth-making."," A York brewer was accused in 1588 of contaminating his beer with urine, although the exact words uttered by the accused were that ‘he did put washe in his drinke’ (YRS138/29). Sometimes it was called ‘old wash’ and in 1716 John Whitehead spoke of going to his father’s house in Almondbury ‘to begg some old wash to wett some pieces of cloath before he carryed them to Mill’ (OWR1/2/). This practice is commented on by the Wakefield cloth frizzer John Brearley in 1762 who said that ‘weeting out and washing’ left some cloths ‘surpriseing thin’ (YRS155/15). The noun ‘weeting’ was used by James Hirst of Wortshill near Huddersfield: when dyeing wool black he said, ‘a bucketful of weeting’ made the colours brighter (OWR1/2/16). </br> An alternative term for urine was ‘lee’ or ‘chamber lee’. John Kaye of Farnley Tyas wrote that ‘upon 26 of Maye 1589 Alice Hepworth (was) sentt by hir Master Edmonde Kay for a kytt full of wash or chamber lee’ and later in the same tale it was called ‘wesshe’ (KayeCB). This was the usual dialect spelling and various informants over the years have told me that the lane which leads from just below the Conservative Club in Longwood to Quarmby Fold is called locally ‘Weshlickerloyn’. An undated entry in a 17th-century account book which recommends ‘howe to die blewe out of  white’ begins with the instruction to ‘Taike 12 gallans of chamberlee’ and ‘sett it on the fire’. When it was close to boiling it was removed and a quarter of a pound of indigo was mixed in before adding the cloth or wool and stirring well (OWR1/2/16). </br> References occur away from the workplace. In a Quarter Sessions case at Wakefield in 1745 it was claimed that a man assaulted a woman and ‘throw’d a chamber pott full of chamberlee and dirt’ on her (QS1). In 1650 at Bowling near Bradford a witness in a witchcraft case described how they had ‘searched the body of the saide Mary Sikes and founde … a redd lumpe about the biggness of a nutt, being wett, and that when they wrung it with theire fingers, moisture came out of it like lee’ (SS40/30). </br> In perhaps the most explicit references the word used by West Riding clothiers was ‘lant’. The inventory of Joseph Holroyd of Upperthong included a ‘lant copper’, the vessel in which the urine was stored (1724) and John Brearley wrote the following in his memorandum book in 1761. </br> <i>For red first boyl the wool in alom then peachwood and logwood so dash a little old lant in or some does without lant. For blew itt is boyled in allom then in logwood so saden with a little piss. The boyled in another vesell with only lant called piss.

watergate ,,,,,,,,"  The suffix ‘gate’ is important in this case for it could mean ‘gate’ in the sense of ‘barrier’ or ‘door’, a contrivance that had to be opened if water was to pass through, or ‘gate’ in the sense of ‘road’, in which case the reference was to a water course or channel.  The first of these meanings applies to references from the fifteenth century where the spelling ‘yate’ confirms that ‘watergate’ could be an alternative to floodgate: 1458-9 <i>pro factura le Wateryattes per Th. Bute in fontans fell, ijs</i> (SS130/84); 1579 <i>They lay in pain that the farr watter yate at Roger Gauntes shalbe well made and a good locke kept of it,</i> Dewsbury (YAJ21/410). </br> On the other hand the watergate was likely to be a drain in a mining context, saving the pit from flooding and allowing the miners to get coal in relatively dry conditions. The earliest examples noted are from Rainton in Durham where expenses are recorded in 1368-9 ‘pro uno Watergat pro minera’ (OED); that is a Watergate for the mine. The first reference to such drains in Yorkshire is in the court rolls of Wakefield manor: in 1340 the steward or ‘grave’ granted a tenant permission to dig for sea-coal in Alverthorpe and also ‘to make a channel under the earth for draining the water’ (WCR12/196). The original text is in Latin, but this translation is clear evidence that some of the earliest pits needed to be drained. </br> The first Yorkshire examples of ‘watergate’ occur in seventeenth-century documents and one note about coal getting in Barwick in Elmet is particularly detailed. Sir Thomas Gascoigne was working shallow pits there in the mid-1600s and water had evidently been a problem. He says that in 1638 he <i>did … sinke the Ginn pitt deeper and added another pumpe</i>, which allowed him to draw the water 20 yards in all, evidently the depth of the pit. The passage that is directly relevant to the draining operation is worth quoting at length: </br> <i>From Parlington Hollins there is two rowes of bottom cole, and one rowe of hardband to be gotten when the ginns shall draw 20 y[ard]e: which to recover there must be 2 water gates driven, one for the high cole and another for the low cole. The higher water gate must be taken out of the bottom of the Ginn pitt which is about 20 yarde deep … </i> </br> He then comments on the necessity of attending to the water courses lest they be <i>lost or misspent … by mold warpe holes or choked by sedges, etc, for want of scouring. </i>His major concern was <i>the Soughe from the wheele race downe to the Cock</i> [the name of the stream] which if it were obstructed would <i>utterly undoe us</i> (Th17/10-1). </br> Coal leases in the Bradford area contain additional information about the way problems with water were dealt with. In 1659 pits in Wibsey were leased to Samuel Littlewood of Hunsworth <i>with free liberty … to drive and make Watergates as well for the wayneing of Coales as for avoydinge of water</i>. The inference is that the ‘gates’ here would be wide, serving principally as drains but also allowing coal to be moved out of the pit by some form of vehicle. Littlewood agreed <i>to maintaine and keep the Watergate or Watergates in good and sufficient manner during the said terme </i>of ten years (MMA/255). Such maintenance involved maintenance work on the drains and additional examples are quoted under the headwords ‘fettle’ and ‘fey’.

wath,wath-stead,,,,,,"‘Wath’ is a word of Scandinavian origin which means ‘ford’, particularly common as a place-name element in Yorkshire and Cumbria."," As a suffix it came under the influence of similar sounding words and there has been confusion with -thwaite, -way, -with and -worth in particular.

The bridge of <i>Brygwath</i> is mentioned several times in accounts for Bolton Priory from 1310 but the name did not survive and the site is not known (YRS154).  The word remained in use in the northern dialects: 1486 ‘to <i>le Wath</i> above the mill pond’, Thornton (YRS63/139); 1655 <i>the wearing of the wath</i>, Kirkby Moorside (NRQS5/195); 1697 <i>From thence I went over a wath which tradition says was formerly a great river running ... into Humber</i> (SS54/153). It alternated with ‘wath-stead’, the site of a wath, and both are used in references to work on the bridge at Skipton on Swale. In 1604 money was advanced for the making of <i>a passable foard, or wath-stead, for cart and carriage</i> (NRQS3/47) but heavy traffic continued and the bridge was ruinous by 1610.

way leave ,,,,,,,," The granting of special rights of way is in evidence from an early date, as when Richard le Walais allowed the prior of Healaugh to use a road 20 feet in width from his old park <i>usque pontem suum de Haganhou … ad cariandum boscum et maheremium</i> (YRS92/52-3). Springwood leases frequently included clauses which had to do with the use of such rights of way, not just controlling access into the woods but also the transporting of material in and through the fields which adjoined the woods. It also controlled the pasturing of carriage animals: in 1377 Walter de Calverley granted one lessee and his associates ‘reasonable ingress and regress … and pasture for his horses that carry his coal’, Calverley (Th6/191). There are similar examples through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: 1527 <i>to have free entree and issue with all maner of cariage into the said two greafes … as afore hath been accustomed withoute vexation</i>, Denby (WBD/3/32); 1548-9 ‘Thomas Nailler and Richard Willey, <i>smethemen</i> … to have sufficient ways for carrying the wood and bark over Rysheworthe’s ground’, Shelf (YRS39/151); 1596 <i>wayeleave for the said Ralph Beistone … with horses, Cartes and Carryages</i>, Beeston (DB129/7); 1620 <i>way leave through the lands and waste grounds to the Brook for watering Cattle</i>, Beeston (DB129/4).

wheel ,,,,,,," ‘Wheel’, more than any other word in the vocabulary of the Hallamshire cutlers, has the power to evoke the great days of the industry. It came into use in the Middle Ages when water wheels on the fast-flowing Don and its tributaries powered the region’s corn and fulling mills, but was used from the Tudor period, certainly from 1496 (WPS166), to refer to the water wheels which drove the grinders’ wheels."," 1542 <i>My Weyle in letel Sheyfeld Moore</i> (WPS140). The ‘wheel’ therefore had double significance and once it was used in the names given to the grinding sites it developed semantically, similar in some respects to the use of ‘mill’ in the textile area. By the 1500s, for example, ‘wheel’ was being used of the buildings which housed the cutlers’ wheels and finally it emerged in its own right as a local place-name element. The use of ‘wheel’ for the water-powered grindstones was explicit in the Cutlers’ Orders of 1590 which placed restrictions on <i>personnes usinge … the said mysteryes or scyence of Cuttlers and having or occupyinge any whele or wheles for gryndinge of Knyves</i> (HCC2). The term ‘cutler wheel’ was in use from the early sixteenth century at least, and a fine in Latin records the sale of lands in Ecclesall and Sheffield in 1607-8 <i>quatuor rotis cultellariis</i>, surely a scribal translation of ‘four cutler wheels’ (YRS53/79). In Harrison’s survey of Sheffield in 1637 the list of <i>The Rents of the Cutler Wheeles</i> had more than forty entries (HSMS31-3). The only grinder’s inventory noted is dated 1728 and <i>All his Concerns at the wheele belonging his trade </i>were valued at £2 10s 0d (FBH103). Certain title deeds illustrate the different phases of the word’s development: 1530-1 ‘one messuage with one water-wheel built above called <i>le Southwhele</i>’, Ecclesfield (TWH20/34); 1715 <i>the other part of the wheel now fallen down</i>, Hawksley Wheel (WPS6). In 1547 Richard King of Sheffield left his <i>wheile</i> to his daughter and in a footnote the historian T Walter Hall wrote: ‘Wheile is an old spelling of wheel and refers to a building used for grinding cutlery’ (TWH13/82). Similarly, C.A. Turner noted that ‘The term wheel refers to the building housing numerous shafts and belts working from one power source’ (CAT17). Several of the word’s attributive uses are dealt with below.

win ,,,,,,,," The expression ‘to win coal’ is met with in many mining contexts but its history is far from straightforward. The verb ‘to win’ can be traced back to Old English and is on record from the ninth century when the associations were with ‘labouring’ or ‘exerting oneself’, even ‘tilling the ground’. Only later did it came to mean ‘overcoming’ or ‘emerging victorious’ although these are the allusions with which we are now most familiar. </br> From the fourteenth century, crops in the fields could be ‘won’, and in Scotland the expression to win coal, stone or other minerals was usual from the 1400s (OED). It was probably a regional term, since the earliest examples in England occur in the northern counties, notably in co. Durham in 1447 (SZ15). In 1708 the phrase ‘to win a Colliery’ was used in the north-east (CC2) and the same writer spoke of ‘Estates or Lands wherein Coal Mines are wrought or may be won’. </br> The first Yorkshire evidence dates from the sixteenth century: 1591 <i>works there made for the getting and winning of coals</i>, Northowram (HAS31/76); 1665 <i>freedom to … dig and win coal</i>, Crigglestone (WCR5/97); 1719 <i>three bencks wining 3s 0d</i>, Farnley (MS11); 1766 <i>whereby the colliery when won may be drowned, set on fire, choked up or otherwise damnified</i>, Boothtown (HAS31/88). It had ‘get’ and ‘gain’ as apparent synonyms: 1754 <i>workmen … employed in or about the gaining, winning or getting of</i> … <i>seams of coal</i>, Beeston (DB129/9) but emerged as the semi-official term in the nineteenth century, used in the Inclosure Award for Shelley: 1803 <i>to have, hold, win, work and enjoy all mines of coal</i>, and in legal documents: 1869 ‘I conceive that coal is won when it is put in a state in which continuous working can go forward in the ordinary way’ (OED).

In 1300 Roger de Mowbray granted the forestership of Hovingham with the rights of windfall to Ralph Kirketon: <i>suam forestarium … cum arboribus vento prostratis et ramis et tanno omnium arborum</i> (NRR2/232). More explicitly the rights granted to George Buschell in Fyling included uprooted trees: 1518 <i>omnia et singula lingna vento prostrata ad terram ac eradicata</i> (MC362).

woollen wheels ,,,,,,," This unusual term had the same meaning as ‘unbound wheels’, that is wheels without a studded metal tyre."," The wheels may also have been padded but I have found no evidence of such a practice. The definition is expressed most clearly in the ordinances of the city of York: 1524 <i>none … shall … cary any of the said dong furth of the said City with their yrinbonwaines … but oonely waines that hath woulne wheylls or els upon sledds, </i>York (YRS106/91).

The following extract from the civic records therefore makes much better sense if we assume that ‘on’ in line six is a mistake for ‘or’: 1497 <i>it was ennacted … that a proclamacion shalbe maid in the opyn market that every denysen and foreyn that bryngez waynez  or cartes bound with yren and loden with any maner stuff, except the Kyngs carriage and comez within this Citie opon the Payvement whiche of newe is maid … shall fro nowfurth pay for every tyme xijd to the common well of this Citie; and thei that bryngs wollen on </i>[sic]<i> unbound waynes or cartes and without any naylez with any maner stuffe to be welcome and to have fre entre and passage</i>, York (YRS103/132).

"," I find no examples of this term in the standard reference works but it occurs several times in documents linked to Yorkshire tanners. In 1658, for example, the final items in the inventory of Richard Wadye of Selby were <i>The working tree, apron, knife, bill, wood with other huslement </i>(YRS47/176): in 1660 John Titlow, also of Selby, had <i>his working tree with the rest of his working tooles</i> valued at 6s (YRS47/170).

workman,workmanlike,workmanly,,,,," By the mid-fifteenth century the word workman had acquired the meaning of ‘skilled craftsman’, and ‘workmanlike’ meant ‘characteristic of a skilful workman’."," There is early evidence in bridge-building records: 1422 quilke forsaide brigge ... sallle be made sufficient and warkmanly in mason crafte, Catterick (NRQS3/33). In 1486 Lady Bridge in Sheffield was judged <i>after the sight of Workmen of the same Crafte</i> (HS1/337) and in 1579 Elland Bridge had to be <i>finished in a workmanlike manner in every respect</i> (BAS6/139). In 1701, Ambrose Pudsay’s report on Skirden Bridge began with the following sentence: <i>And having taken Some Workmen along with me, the better to informe me what work is necessary … Certifie this Court that there must be erected … one new Land Stall, etc</i>’ (QS1/40/4). The same standards operated in other crafts, in metal work for example: 1475 <i>dight no swerdes but warkemanlyke</i>, York (YRS106/179). An Act of 1624 wanted cutlers who were responsible for <i>unworkmanly wares</i> to be penalised (HCC7) and entries in the searchers records mention <i>sizzors unworkmanly wrought</i> in 1704 and <i>Searching for unworkmanlike wares</i> in 1715 (HCC22).  The terms are found in springwood leases from the eighteenth century: 1766 <i>workmen shall and will in a … workmanlike manner according to the best and most approved method for encouraging the future Springing and growth … cut down and fall the said woods</i>, Quarmby (DD/T/33/1). This more specialised meaning of the word is implicit in a Lepton bye-law of 1623: <i>that no man take anye Coles … without workmens consent</i> (WBM). In a South Crosland lease of 1666 the lessees were to leave the pit in good repair and its condition was to be <i>att the discresion of two workemen</i> (WBD/2/81).

wormstall ,,,,,,," As a vocabulary item ‘wormstall’ is defined in the OED as ‘an outdoor shelter for cattle in warm weather’, and the inference is that ‘shelter’ refers to a building, such as a shed."," The first evidence quoted is Philemon Holland’s translation of Pliny’s Natural History, dated 1601: ‘Drive thy sheepe and cattail out of the Sunne, into some worme-stalle and place of shade’. Wright defined ‘wormstall’ as ‘an outdoor shed or shelter into which cattle retire to avoid flies in warm weather’ (EDD) and numerous other writers have accepted that meaning. The only evidence for ‘wormstall’ that I have found is as a place-name, and it was not infrequent in Yorkshire. It is likely though to belong to a much earlier period in English history than has been assumed, for Old English <i>wyrmsteall</i> occurs twice in charter boundaries (PNBk318). Many people would therefore have been familiar with ‘Wormstall’ as a place-name long before the word was used by Philemon Holland in 1601. In Methley, for example, a manorial survey of 1592 has an entry for ‘<i>two closes called Wormestalles</i>’ and the same field name is recorded in the court rolls fifty years earlier: 1543 ‘the <i>steiles</i> outside a close called <i>Wormstall</i>’ (Th35/126,206). A similar reference is found in a Dissolution valuation of lands in Selby which had belonged to the abbey: 1540 <i>ij closes called the Wormestall Closes cont. ix acres</i> (YRS13/350). An even earlier reference occurs in an undated charter for Longwood near Huddersfield, probably executed in the first two decades of the thirteenth century: ‘fifteen pence which Thomas his brother ought to pay for four acres of land in <i>Wrmstalhirst</i>’; that is a ‘wormstall’ in or close to a ‘hirst’or small wood (Font137). <i>Wormstall Clough</i> in Barkisland near by occurs in a title deed in 1665 (DD/SR/10/39). </br>The spellings in the examples just quoted seem to rule out the possibility that the prefix ‘worm’ developed as a form of ‘oumer’, so it would be more logical to take it at face value and link it with Old English <i>wyrm</i>. This had a wide variety of meanings and could be applied to animals as diverse as toads and hunting dogs, e.g. 1514 <i>grewhondis and ratches and other smale wormys</i>, Moor Monckton (YRS41/168). As a common place-name ‘Wormstall’ may originally have meant something like ‘worm - place’ or ‘unpleasant creature - place’. </br> If that is so it raises a question about how we interpret Holland’s ‘worme-stalle’ (1601) which has been taken to refer to a building. Perhaps it was simply reinforcing ‘place of shade’, extending its meaning to ‘secluded’ or ‘out-of-the-way’. Markham used the word to mean a ‘shelter’ or shed in 1613 and this definition is the one that writers seem to have relied on ever since.

wrack,wreck,,,,,,,"These are alternative spellings of a word which has a long history in Yorkshire: the privileges of the church of Ripon in 1228 included <i>wrek, </i>in this sense things lost at sea and whatever was cast up on the shore (SS74/52). It included whales as late as the seventeenth century: in 1666 eleven North Riding men were charged at the Quarter Sessions with <i>taking a whale and other wrecke</i> (NRQS6/101). In the sense of river debris it is noted in a Barkisland lease of 1580 which granted the tenant <i>libertie to skower, clense and empyte the … Streame … from all manner of Sande, wreacke and other noisome things</i> (HMB/140). In the, Payments were made at the North Riding Quarter Sessions in 1743 to William Bielby ‘for clearing away the wreck from How and Kirby Misperton Bridges’, and the editor noted that in the swift-flowing becks of North Yorkshire he had seen timber and branches of trees carried along by floods of even ‘ordinary dimensions’ (NRQS1/242). In 1782, the minister at Slaithwaite recorded in his diary:<i> a heavy storm of Lightning Thunder and Rain. The little Brook before our House was very rapid … it broke down Part of Daniel Eagland’s Field Wall and left a great Wreck Heap in Horsfall’s Pit </i>(KC242/1). </br> Entries in the court rolls of Wakefield manor record the word in 1339-40, beginning with an inquiry into ‘five acres of <i>Wreke</i> in Pokenale’ deposited by the River Calder. The matter dragged on for some time and the amount had decreased to three acres by July 1340, presumably as efforts were made to restore the land to normal use (WCR12148,240). ‘<i>Pokenale</i>’ is the early spelling of Pugneys, where an extensive lake is now the focal point of a country park in Sandal near Wakefield. The word occurs as a verb in a report of 1688 about flood damage at Addingham: </br> <i>And soe it was that about a yeare agoe there fell on a sudden such a violent storme and tempest of raine that the said river was soe great that it did most wonderfully overflow the bankes, tooke downe the said bridge, broak the weares in severall places, endangering severall houses and families and spoiled many meadows to the great loss of the inhabitants, being put to great charges in the repairing the weares and making up the bankes againe as also in making the streets and places passable wher the water had soe wrackt and worne </i>(QS1/27/4). </br> It is not an isolated example. In 1634, Thomas Sandal was paid for work on the paving of Rotherham Bridge, <i>where the water had wreckt up</i> (OED) and in <i>c</i>.1685 a Conistone farmer wrote in his accounts of <i>Corrupt ground Which hath been flouded or wrecced</i> (RW10). In 1860, when Queen Street in Huddersfield, was flooded, the drains were said to be <i>wrecked up</i> (KHT9/7/2). It is likely that damage occurred in some such cases but that meaning is not necessarily implicit in this use of ‘to wreck’. The emphasis seems to be on the accumulation of wreck or debris by the flooding water. According to the Rev. J.C. Atkinson ‘wrack’ or ‘wreck’ were words used for sea-weed in all the maritime parts of Cleveland, and he understood them to mean ‘that which is cast ashore’. In 1654 a Brotton yeoman was fined 6d ‘for unjustly taking ten horse load of sea-wreck’ (NRQS5/160). </br> As a place-name element the word has received little attention although several examples can be noted. In Methley, a pasture of ‘land lying at the water of <i>Kelder</i>’ was called <i>Wrekland</i> in 1465 and subsequent aliases confirm the origin, e.g. 1572 <i>Sandbeddes, Stanilees or Wracklandes</i> (Th35/182,217). Much earlier, in the court roll of 1365 ‘it was presented that the land at <i>Stanleighs</i> gains by reason of <i>wreck </i>although by how much they could not say. Tenants were set the task of deciding on the extent of the ‘new’ land and separating it from other holdings, and in 1472 an inquisition looked into ‘dividing a parcel of land lying at the water of Kelder … in <i>Stanleis</i> from land … called <i>Wreckland</i> there’ (Th35/184). Other Yorkshire names which almost certainly belong here are: 1236 <i>Wreckeflatte</i> Fylingdales (PNNR326); 1576 <i>Wreckeholme</i>, Hampsthwaite (PNWR5/131).

wrangland ,,,,,,,," In the open field system the unit of cultivation was the strip or ‘land’ and these were in groups, often known as furlongs or shutts. It was usual for the strips to be long and have just a slight ‘S’ shaped curve be straight but the terrain meant that was not always possible. One of the words used to describe more crooked strips was ‘wrang’, a spelling of wrong which was common in Yorkshire and survives in dialect speech. It survives also in the place-name Wranglands Drain in Appleton Roebuck and Wranglands in Preston in Holderness. The use of ‘wrang land’ as a vocabulary item seems to be implicit in a North Riding conveyance of 1613 in which six acres of arable, meadow and pasture in the common fields of Huntington included<i> a brode wrangland … lying between six narrow wranglands </i>(NRQS4/143). In South Cave in 1618 <i>a wrangland of wheat</i> was valued at 10s in the inventory of John Marshall (Kaner270). </br> Other references are to very early place-names and they possibly record pre-Conquest uses of the term.

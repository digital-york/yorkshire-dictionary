  <p>
	This page shows details about a single place from the dictionary. 
  </p>
  </p>
	When a word is mentioned in a source material, it is often in tandem with a 
	place. For example, the location that a word is believed to have originated 
	in or is known to have been used.
  </p>
  <p>
	A map is displayed at the top of the page if we were able to find it.
  </p>
  <p>
	Underneath the map (if it's present) is a list of words associated with the
	place. You can click the word to go to it's definition, and usually find more
	information about the association with the place.
